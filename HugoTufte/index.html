The book was as Isaac Asimov later noted, probably the best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions, and:</p><blockquote><p>This book, then, should lead us to question the limitations we set to our Universe generally, not only those that are mathematical and physical, but those that are sociological as well. How far are our assumptions justified, and to what extent are they merely careless, or self-serving, misinterpretations of reality?<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-1 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class=sidenote>Isaac Asimov, Limitations, Introduction to Flatland, Barnes & Noble edition, 1983</span></p></blockquote><p>With Isaac Asimov advising us to be careful in our assumptions about reality and Wolfgang Pauli advocating for a new idea about it, we might all do well to reconsider our views of reality and to move on from conceptions formed centuries ago but that have been shown to be untenable by modern physics. Just as the citizens of Flatland were blind to dimensions beyond their comprehension, the super-scientific narrative that dominates much of modern Western society appears to be trapped within a conceptual framework that obscures deeper aspects of reality. For centuries, Western thought has been dominated by the 17th century classical physics framework of mechanistic determinism that everything in the universe unfolds as the inevitable result of preceding conditions. In this view, agency and free will seem illusory, leaving only the inexorable march of cause and effect.

appear to accept this as evidence for a strictly physicalist universe, where all mental phenomena, including consciousness, are reducible to physical processes.</p><p>But what if the conception of reality held by many if not most scientists and philosophers is as limited as that of Abbotts Flatlanders? What if consciousness and matter are deeply linked? Could mind, spirit, or a similar term be as fundamental as the physical properties that science currently believes completely describe reality? Asimovs admonition and Paulis challenge would then be more urgent than ever: to at least consider a new idea of reality that accounts for both the discoveries of modern physics and the enduring mysteries of consciousness. But what might such a new idea of reality look like or include?</p><p>First, a brief digression about the constraints and limitations inherent in language, particularly for the word consciousness, a central theme here. Consciousness is a word thats often if not typically used quite casually, as if everyone sufficiently understands what it means (or, perhaps, what it doesnt mean). Although its impossible to have this sort of discussion without using the word consciousness, its important indeed critical to acknowledge the inherently provisional and ambiguous nature of the term. David Chalmers, who has written quite a bit about consciousness, noted that the definition of consciousness in the International Dictionary of Psychology does not even try to give a straightforward characterization:</p><p>Consciousness: The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means. Many fall into the trap of confusing consciousness with self-consciousnessto be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written about it.

The nature of consciousness, they say, is an awesome mystery. Its the ultimate hard problem.<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-4 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

I find this odd because we know exactly what consciousness is where by consciousness I mean what most people mean in this debate: experience of any kind whatever. Its the most familiar thing there is, whether its experience of emotion, pain, understanding what someone is saying, seeing, hearing, touching, tasting or feeling. It is in fact the only thing in the universe whose ultimate intrinsic nature we can claim to know. It is utterly unmysterious.<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-5 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

Exploring possible elements of those more expansive conceptions is a large part of what Im trying to do in this project. Its all very provisional, however, as our current ideas about consciousness will likely one day be thought as narrow as the Greek terms for electricity and magnetism were over two thousand years ago.<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-6 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

Its also possible that we are at the beginning of a conceptual revolution as or more radical than the Cartesian revolution was to the Aristotelian framework, and that, as Marcus Appleby speculates, we will one day only use the words consciousness and matter in their everyday meaning.<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-7 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

Its a contentious debate, however, as there are several very different ways to interpret the bizarre findings of QM, some of which are compatible with a classical deterministic universe. The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), for example, proposes that all possibilities unfold in parallel, rendering the universe fully deterministic other interpretations suggest that consciousness<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-8 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

plays a fundamental role in shaping reality.</p><p>The idea that consciousness and quantum mechanics are deeply linked has been advanced by a number of prominent physicists, including John van Neumann, Wolfgang Pauli, David Bohm, and others. Pauli, one of the pioneers of quantum physics, believed that QM demands a new way of thinking about realityone that seems likely to require abandoning long-held assumptions. Over a decades-long collaboration, Pauli and Carl Jung developed what has come to be known as the Pauli-Jung Conjecture, a radical **** The psychophysical continuum that Pauli and Carl Jung proposed is an example of the such a new way of thinking, a conjecture that offers a bridge between the rigors of physics and the imaginal realm of subjective phenomena.</p><p>The imaginal realm is a term that some have come to use as a broad label for the subjective, experiential and symbolic dimensions of reality, aspects of higher-sentience life<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-9 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

that are almost by definition not addressable through scientific methods.</p><p>Is symbolism fundamental to some sort of cosmic language or means of understanding, a cornerstone for levels of abstraction that, on earth, humans appear to be uniquely capable of? Or is symbolism something of an interim phase, perhaps most usefully as a window into aspects of reality that are not available through our physical senses, and, in modern Western culture, an antidote to the spiritually toxic constraints of physicalism? And what of abstraction, the gem of human exceptionalism? Is it really the end-all of higher intelligence, the holy grail of cosmic achievement? Or is abstraction just another variation of symbolism, albeit one in very different form?
And what about the word consciousness? Its a word thats tossed around quite casually, as if everyone knows pretty much exactly what it means (or, at the very least, what it doesnt mean). But is consciousness even a thing (or perhaps an event), something akin to, say, an elephant or eating?</p><p>Other possible bridges between the realms of physicists and mystics have been suggested through various philosophical perspectives such as panpsychism, panentheism, and neutral monism.

Nagel argues for a third way, a fully natural tertium quid that can account for what we can be reasonably sure of both objectively and subjectively. In Mind and Cosmos, Nagel asks:</p><blockquote><p>But would an alternative secular conception be possible that acknowledged mind and all that it implies, not as the expression of divine intervention but as a fundamental principle of nature along with physical law? Could it take the form of a unified conception of the natural order, even if it tries to accommodate a richer set of materials than the austere elements of mathematical physics?<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-10 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

In principle, the entirety of the universe can be traced back to its beginning. No supernatural forces are in play,</p><p>Quantum mechanics (QM) suggests that the deterministic classical world emerges from an underlying framework where outcomes are fundamentally probabilistic, although the nature of this transition remains debated. The underlying issues are complex and border on metaphysics, particularly concerning the role of observation and the nature of reality.

It is a debate that will not be settled through physics anytime soon.</p><p>The tension between what can broadly be characterized as scientific and religious worldviews

Its a question that is much more complicated than most think.</p><p><em>Flatland</em> is a humbling reminder of the difficulty most of us have in attempting to wrap our minds around the possibility of dimensions beyond the three we currently live in and largely assume are all that exist in our universe.
But the concept of dimensions beyond those of our perceived physical existence are not only the domain of philosophy. Theoretical physics is very much of additional dimensions: the current models for string theory all require multiple dimensions. But those dimensions are abstract elements, a mathematical sleight-of-hand required to make the equations balance out.</p><p>Most contemporary scientists and philosophers believe that reality is exclusively physical and that science is the only means of establishing truths about it. Belief in non-physical realms is dismissed as either pre-scientific nonsense or a useful fiction that many accept because it makes their life feel more complete or secure. But some of us who believe that modern science has discovered fundamental truths about the universe also believe, or at the very leas sense, that we are part of something much bigger, some sort of a grand cosmic order and thereby face a dilemma in reconciling that sense with our belief in science. Is our sense of deep connection something we just imagine, some sort of adaptive tonic generated by our brain? Or could reality include non-physical dimensions or properties that we are presently as blind to as the two-dimensional denizens of Edwin Abbots <em>Flatland</em> were when a sphere passed through their realm?
Of course, the idea that reality includes fundamental, non-material properties directly conflicts with what most of todays scientists and philosophers believe. It is, in their view, simply nonsense. According to the scientific models and narratives that dominate contemporary Western thought, there is no place for such fictions.

There is no scientific evidence that it is true, nor is there any conceivable scientific experiment that could confirm or deny it, as science is limited to exploring only physical objects and the forces that affect them.</p><p>The crux of this is consciousness.

The 1989 <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_International_Dictionary_of_Psycholo/E8ksAAAAMAAJ?hl=en"><em>International Dictionary of Psychology</em></a> did not even try to define consciousness, saying simply that Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it evolved.

is as fundamental as charge or mass
consciousness is ubiquitous,
and humans are a latecomer to highly-intelligent species on Earth.</p><p>More than a philosophical perspective or imaginary narrative, a premise here is that the essence of this theme corresponds to the way the world really is (the same claim as made by physicalists). It takes as a starting point that the standard scientistic orthodoxy of a purely material or physical universe is incomplete and simply wrong in its presumption that consciousness and the vast spectrum of subjective or experiential phenomena are exclusively derivatives of physical processes.</p><p>Well explore this story here through a mixture of ideas from Western philosophies and esoteric traditions along with discoveries and conjectures of modern science, particularly physics and biology. Variants of idealism, panpsychism and others with a selective sprinkling of principles from esoteric or occult perspectives fall into the broader composite considered here.</p><p>Its important to acknowledges that efforts to tell this story are hampered by our language, grounded as it is in an old, classical view of the world. Just as the two-dimensional denizens of Edwin Abbeys <em>Flatland</em> could neither describe nor conceive of the sphere that passed through their world, the languages and basic conceptions of contemporary Western civilization, with their roots in supernatural and physicalist presumptions, can (at least for now) only provide relatively crude approximations of what is shaping up to be a radically different perspective of reality.</p><p>In the end, of course, this is a matter of belief, different only in type from the prevailing scientistic commitment to physicalism: that science is the only valid means of reaching truth about the Universe and that everything (including consciousness and subjective phenomena) is exclusively physical. ..This is, of course, a belief, no different except in conclusion from the foundational premise of modern neuroscience that all subjective phenomena such as mind or consciousness are derivatives of purely physical processes. But it appears to offer a much richer means of accommodating the immense spectrum of subjective phenomena that collectively represent much of what it means to be sentient and, more narrowly, human.</p><p>But unlike physicalism, worldviews in which spirit is fundamental connect to the essence of sentience and humanity. It is difficult to imagine a meaningful takeaway from physicalism about how to live ones life, but acknowledging a deep sense of spirituality as a fully natural phenomenon opens very many ways to align values, behaviors with ones conception of the world. The spirituality considered here, however, is not supernatural; it does not derive from an omnipotent agent or invoke non-material entities. It is entirely natural, inherent to all that is, and far more. As water is to fish its simply what we are immersed within.</p><p>The standard scientific narrative, accepted by just about everyone in contemporary academia, holds that Life on earth (and anywhere else in the cosmos it may have occurred) is a bizarre accident in an otherwise cold and sterile universe, the result of random chemical reactions in a primordial soup that evolved over billions of years and eventually produced what we perceive of as consciousness. There is in this view no underlying purpose, meaning, or anything but the random workings of adaptive evolution.</p><p>None of this is new. The ideas are circulating in various forms
incomplete, provisional, and very different from the dominant narratives in contemporary Western thought, more of a framework for further discussion. But if even part of this story is more or less true, it could be as if not more revolutionary than any other previous change in perspective about the nature of reality.
It is speculative, incomplete, and provisional, but, my hope is, a small contribution to the growing set of mind-centric conceptions about the nature of the world.
Many philosophical perspectives are potential alternatives to the physicalist conception. Philosophical labels for these ideas include panpsychism, duaand variants (e.g., panentheism, ****), neutral monism, and a psychophysical continuum. What is often if not typically assumed in discussions about these and related ideas, however, is that Western languages are up to the task of adequately describing elements of such a new worldview. Just as the two-dimensional denizens of Edwin Abbeys <em>Flatland</em> had no way to describe the sphere that passed through their world, the languages of contemporary Western civilization, with their roots in supernatural and physicalist presumptions, can (at least for now) only provide relatively crude approximations of a radically different conception of reality.</p><p>==============</p><p>The idea that mind is a fundamental property or aspect of all that is has been part of Western thought from the birth of Ancient Greek philosophy.<br>idealism (the idea that reality is fundamentally mental or spiritual), panpsychism (a set of ideas holding that consciousness or mind is a fundamental aspect of the universe), Broad interest in mind as a fundamental property of the universe has waxed and waned since the 16th century,<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-25 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

meshes with a wide range of spiritual narratives and that appears to be supported (or at least is not contradicted) by discoveries of modern science. Far from fully-formed, it is just a rough approximation, incomplete and provisional but perhaps enough to provide a starting point for further discussions.</p><p>It is, however, not a straightforward story that can be told tightly through logical progression more like a hologram, individual pieces can represent the entire image (albeit with very low resolution), but the clarity of the image increases as more and more pieces are brought together. So the approach here is to lay out many sometimes seemingly disparate ideas and observations from philosophy, science, and spiritual narratives, things that collectively represent a world fundamentally different from what most contemporary scientists and philosophers believe it to be.</p><p>Although it goes directly to the heart of many big questions, or perhaps because of that, this does not appear to be a conversation that many people will engage in. It requires personal depth and an open mind, intellectual or spiritual curiosity, a strong sense of introspection, and a wariness of credulity. Skepticism, an entirely understandable response, must be balanced with the recognition that none of this can be proven; it is fundamentally a matter of belief ( as is the physicalist conception).</p><h2 id=spiritual-frameworks-in-the-west>Spiritual Frameworks in the West</h2><p>To a first approximation, three frameworks or worldviews underly most conceptions of spirit in Western thought: physicalism, supernaturalism, and what may be broadly grouped as nature-based cosmologies. In the physicalist paradigm, notions of spirit are purely the result of electrochemical processes in a (probably only) human brain as are all forms and expressions of consciousness in animals.

<span class=sidenote><a href=https://www.andrewnewberg.com/>Andrew Newberg</a> notes that relating conscious experience to brain function is a relatively recent notion: neurology was overwhelmingly indifferent to mental life during the bulk of its history.Rather, it concerned itself with movement, spinal reflexes, and other physical functions while leaving mental life to the realm of psychiatry and philosophy. <em>Wednesday is Indigo Blue,</em> p. 16</span>
but has quickly become the dominant scientific perspective, is based on the presumption that the fundamentals of reality are exclusively physical, that everything that exists can at least in principle be traced back to something measurable. Although there is a very wide range of ideas about just how brains may generate consciousness and derivatives such as notions of spirit there is virtual unanimity in the scientific community that a complete explanation of consciousness will be strictly physical.</p><p>Supernaturalism, a dualistic belief in forces, phenomena, or entities that are beyond the natural world, is the millennia-old foundation of most Western religious beliefs and traditions. Supernaturalism is most commonly associated with monotheistic conceptions of an omnipotent God, but it also includes belief in a non-material spirit world that can be accessed through channelers.<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-29 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

Believers in supernaturalism usually cede to science for explanations of the natural world but maintain that the world of spirit is beyond any possible scientific investigation.</p><p>Nature-based cosmologies span a wide range of belief systems including indigenous spiritualities, contemporary paganism, Gaianism, and eco-spiritual perspectives. Although very different in cultural contexts and practices, they tend to have common beliefs such as the interconnectedness and interdependence of all things, the importance of maintaining balance and harmony, ethical responsibility to the Earth and its inhabitants, and the inseparableness of material and spiritual realms.</p><p>Adherents of each view, particularly physicalism and supernaturalism, are often true-believers with a tendency toward observational bias<label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-30 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

and an unwillingness to seriously consider other perspectives.</p><p>A fourth framework with roots in antiquity and a renewed interest through modern physics is beginning to emerge,<br>The vision of participating in a consciously evolving world has greatly expanded through the work of D.S. Wilson and others who have dared to advance ideas challenging the orthodoxy of the Modern Synthesis and its presumption of randomness as the exclusive means of adaptation. Ostroms ideas about cultural adaptation add an important layer and further explanatory power to the notion that human consciousness is evolving.<br>An obscure but potential contribution to the growing narrative of conscious evolution comes from speculations about consciousness that emerged out of quantum foundations over the past several decades. The idea that consciousness may be fundamental to reality, long a basic tenet of Western esoteric philosophy, has become more respectable (at least in non-esoteric circles) with the advent of quantum mechanics.
Although several founders of quantum theory expressed ideas that suggested at least a hint of mysticism, Wolfgang Pauli went further. In a decades-long collaboration, Pauli and Carl Jung developed their ideas about a psychophysically neutral reality, combining their experience in quantum mechanics and depth psychology to propose a framework that synthesized mental and physical properties.
Their basic premise is a form of dual-aspect monism, the idea that mind and matter do not exist independently but are two different aspects of an underlying and unified reality. Pauli and Jung particularly explored the idea of serendipity, but variations of dual-aspect monism or similar notions have been advanced or endorsed by other philosophers and physicists. A possible but significant implication of these monistic conceptions is that non-material phenomena such as spirituality and values derive from something more fundamental than electrochemical reactions in a brain.<br>Might this in some way align with a core premise of some Western esoteric philosophies, that human consciousness is evolving through the power of thought, both individual and collective, a premise that appears to be quite similar to a core element of ProSocial, that every person is in a position to start consciously evolving both the vertical and horizontal dimensions of their meaning systems for the groups in their own lives.
Could these be different ways of saying the same thing? Is it possible that mind, consciousness, or spirit are more or less equivalent and somehow a fundamental property of the universe? Could this be part of the tertium quid that Thomas Nagel is looking for, a middle-ground between the prevailing poles of theism/supernaturalism and reductive materialism? Do monistic narratives have equivalent (or possibly stronger) power for individual motivation and action (the first two of Wilsons three criteria), not to mention the possibility of a tighter explanatory framework that explicitly accommodates the idea of fundamental, qualitative phenomena ?
And what about large-brained, non-human animals? Are they not subject to the same evolutionary forces of consciousness as Homo sapiens? Does the fact that dozens of large-brained species have been morphologically stable for millions of years have any significance in a discussion about broader conceptions of consciousness?
These are some of the questions that could be explored in a forum for ideas that dont fit comfortably in conventional narratives of consciousness but may better align with a vastly greater reality that we are only beginning to apprehend.</p><p>are they both referring to the same thing? Just what is the reality they are apparently both talking about? Isnt a basic conception of reality more or less obvious? After all, we commonly refer to crazy people as being detached from reality. Most of us probably think that reality is more or less obvious, that its the But as well see, that common conception of reality is at best simplistic and at worst inaccurate. And its not just a philosophical issue: the bizarre discoveries modern physics, particularly quantum mechanics, have made questions about the nature of reality more than a philosophical abstraction.</p><p><label for=sidenote-3976528693a0108357f4928017600865-31 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
