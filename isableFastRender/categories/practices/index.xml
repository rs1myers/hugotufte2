      <description>A.H. Maslow coined a number of terms that have come into common parlance beyond academic psychology , including &amp;ldquo;hierarchy of needs&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;self-actualization&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;peak experience&amp;rdquo;. In his last book, The Farther Reaches of Human Nature, Maslow uses the term &amp;ldquo;full humanness&amp;rdquo; to describe psychologically healthy and mature people&amp;ndash; those who are self-actualized and beyond. But what defines a self-actualized person?Â And what lies beyond self-actualization?
Maslow understood the inherent difficulty of explicitly answering such subjective questions.</description>

      <description>Download PDF version Christianity has gone through a number of significant metamorphoses over the last two millennia, some of them radical enough to permanently change the nature of the West&amp;rsquo;s foremost religion. Another radical change is beginning to swell through the sea of mainstream Christianity as increasing numbers of thoughtful Christians challenge the prevailing doctrines of separation and exclusion, preferring instead to focus on the personal change that comes from a sincere attempt to emulate the life of Jesus.</description>
