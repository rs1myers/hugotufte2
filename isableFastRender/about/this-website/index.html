<h1 class="sc-title">This Website</h1>

 
  
  
  
    
    
  
  </section>
    

    <section><p>This website is a tool for helping me clarify my thoughts about the way the world appears to be. Some of it deals with realities that all educated persons agree on, things that we can be certain are true. These are physical facts,the products of scientific investigation, and they are often rather trivial. The earth does in fact make one revolution around the sun, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year">sidereal year</a>, in approximately 365.25636 days. Planck&rsquo;s constant really is (exactly) $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ joule·seconds. Consciousness and neural activity are inextricably connected. But of far greater importance, I believe, are the stories that we tell ourselves about those and so many other facts, stories about the nature of the world. Narratives about what a set of facts or observations mean, stories, are where the real action is.</p>
<p>Just about everything of significance derives not from the things we can measure, but from the stories we tell about them. The (more or less) absolute predictability of planetary motion does indeed indicate that the universe operates in a mechanical, machine-like way. But does that mean that life is similarly machine-like.</p>
<p>For a long time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a notion of fundamental mind that melds broad hylozoism, findings of modern physics and other scientific disciplines, and an imaginative expansion from investigations of non-human animals, particularly Odontocetes (toothed whales such as orcas, dolphins, etc.) At its core, the idea is that the fundamental nature of reality includes both qualitative and quantitative properties—extending beyond what is merely measurable. Once we have escaped from the narrow view of the universe as exclusively physical, the horizon of worldviews worthy of serious consideration expands tremendously.</p>
<p>This is hardly a new way of thinking, as hylozoist and similar monist views have been argued for by philosophers, esoteric authors and other thinkers throughout history.
For several centuries, the dominance of science—particularly its reductive materialist framework—overshadowed these perspectives. However, with the increasing recognition of consciousness as a fundamental issue in science and philosophy, holist perspectives are gaining more traction.</p>
<p>Evidences that appear to support the conceptions of holism and fundamental mind can be found in many places, but they remain somewhat piecemeal. Pulling some of them together is what I try to do here. Trying to express and integrate such wide ranging ideas in a coherent manner, however, is very humbling for someone who knows so little about any of them. As C.S. Lewis wrote: &ldquo;I do not sit down at my desk to put into verse something that is already clear in my mind. If it were clear in my mind, I should have no incentive or need to write about it.&ldquo;<label for="sidenote-9fce89bc6b78a6ce13cf842ac3ef3b50-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-9fce89bc6b78a6ce13cf842ac3ef3b50-0" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">C.S. Lewis, <em>Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer</em> (1964)</span>
</p>
<p>My goal is not to argue for a single worldview but to broaden the conceptual space for discussing alternative narratives and perspectives.<label for="sidenote-9fce89bc6b78a6ce13cf842ac3ef3b50-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-9fce89bc6b78a6ce13cf842ac3ef3b50-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">The term &ldquo;conceptual space&rdquo; was used by Lorraine L. Besser and Shigehiro Oishi in “The psychologically rich life.”</span>
 The articles here are a mosaic of ideas about a few select areas of the immensely broad but yet barely explored territory of a holistic cosmos and fundamental mind. Once we get past the myopic notion that reality, which is to say consciousness,<label for="sidenote-9fce89bc6b78a6ce13cf842ac3ef3b50-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-9fce89bc6b78a6ce13cf842ac3ef3b50-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">See “Jerison’s take on reality”</span>
 is exclusively physical, the horizon may extend beyond what we can even imagine.</p>
<p>Expanding a conceptual horizon inevitably brings with it speculative and unconventional ideas. While this calls for thoughtful discernment, we should be careful not to dismiss unconventional perspectives too quickly.<label for="sidenote-9fce89bc6b78a6ce13cf842ac3ef3b50-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-9fce89bc6b78a6ce13cf842ac3ef3b50-3" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">It seems safe to exclude <a href="https://www.spaghettimonster.org/">Pastafarianism</a> in serious discussions about spirituality. But the idea that religions are a form of mental illness should be seen as equally absurd, as claimed by Sam Harris in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Faith"><em>The End of Faith</em></a>.</span>
</p>
<p>The articles here are all works in progress, varying in their level of completion. I tend to prioritize exploring more material, even if it&rsquo;s roughly stated, rather than refining fewer pieces to a higher degree. This approach can sometimes result in inconsistencies or unfinished ideas. If you have suggestions for improvement, please <a href="http://localhost:1313/contact/">let me know</a>&ndash;  I look forward to good criticism.</p>
<h2 id="edward-tufte-style">Edward Tufte style</h2>
<p>The site was built with a <a href="https://github.com/loikein/hugo-tufte">GitHub Hugo theme</a> based on Edward Tufte&rsquo;s ideas, and the very strong tutelage of ChatGPT (no way I could have done this on my own). The <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS package</a> was developed by <a href="https://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepman</a> &ldquo;to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte&rsquo;s books and handouts.&rdquo;  Tufte is revered by many for his simple, elegant approach to presenting information, particularly data visualization.  Many of his books, all self-published,<label for="sidenote-9fce89bc6b78a6ce13cf842ac3ef3b50-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-9fce89bc6b78a6ce13cf842ac3ef3b50-5" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Tufte was turned down by numerous publishing houses, finally deciding to mortgage his house and self-publish his first book <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/book/the-visual-display-of-quantitative-information"><em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em></a> in 1983.</span>
 are widely considered classics by technical editors and professionals whose job includes communicating technical information.  Tufte has a particularly low regard for Power Point presentations. His 2003 eBook <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/book/the-cognitive-style-of-powerpoint-pitching-out-corrupts-within-ebook/"><em>The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within</em></a> argues that Power Point presentations may have contributed significantly to the Columbia shuttle disaster through
jargon-heavy, carelessly structured bullet points by Boeing engineers in presentations about the potential for foam debris to have damaged the shuttle&rsquo;s wing.</p>
