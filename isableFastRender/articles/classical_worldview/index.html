<h1 class="sc-title">classical worldview</h1>

 
  
  
  
    
    
  
  </section>
    

    <section><p>The term &ldquo;classical worldview&rdquo; is broadly used to describe the
scientific description of the world that began with Greek philosophers
and reached its zenith in the 19th century. It was conceived 2,500 years
ago as a rational replacement of myths about gods who controlled the
world by imposing their whims through acts of nature they caused. As
Morris Kline put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Greek intellectuals adopted a totally new attitude toward nature. This attitude was rational, critical, and secular. Mythology was discarded as was the belief that the gods manipulate man and the physical world according to their whims. The intellectuals eventually arrived at the doctrine that nature is orderly and functions invariably according to a grand design. All phenomena apparent to the senses, from the motion of the planets to the stirrings of the leaves on a tree, can be fitted into a precise, coherent, intelligible pattern. In short, nature is rationally designed and that design, though unaffected by human actions, can be apprehended by man&rsquo;s mind.&ldquo;<label for="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<p>For almost two thousand years, western conceptions of the universe
revolved around the Aristotelian notion that Earth was stationary and at
the center of the universe, and that the surrounding heavens were
perfection.<label for="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">This is of course only a subset of Aristotelian philosophy, but it suffices for current purposes.</span>
 Aristotle and other Greek philosophers laid the groundwork for a rational and secular inquiry into nature, but the mechanistic and mathematical orientation of classical physics as we know it truly emerged during the Scientific Revolution which many trace to Nicholas Copernicus&rsquo;s
insight that the earth moves and orbits the sun&mdash; a claim verified
through Galileo&rsquo;s observations of planetary motion and the mathematics
of elliptical orbits developed by Johannes Kepler. The heliocentric
system ripped Earth (and therefore humankind)<label for="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">The term &ldquo;mankind&rdquo; was more or less exclusively used through the 20th century, but is appropriately abandoned now.</span>
 from the center of the
universe, but retained the conception of the world as a knowable
place that at least in principle can be fully described by the laws of
physics.<label for="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Paraphrased from Richard Tarnas&rsquo; <em>Cosmos and Psyche</em>. Tarnas asserts that the effects of this disruption
continue to this day. See <a href="https://cosmosandpsyche.com/"><em>Cosmos and Psyche</em></a> for a
detailed defense.</span>
</p>
<p>In this framework, now referred to as &ldquo;classical physics&rdquo;&mdash; and
apparently still held by most contemporary scientists and philosophers&mdash;
the universe is a vast system of objects, fields and forces that affect
them, all interacting predictably by a set of laws that can be
completely described through mathematics. It is a  worldview born by Francis
Bacon, Galileo Galilei and René Descartes in the 17th century. Alongside the rise of empirical methods and mathematical modeling championed by Bacon and Galileo, Descartes introduced a sharp division between mind and matter—a dualism that would deeply influence both scientific and philosophical thought. In this view the material world as we see it is a concrete reality independent of human perception and ultimately understandable with certainty through mathematics&ndash; and it represented a sea-change in the Western conception of reality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is now something of a platitude to point out that our world view underwent a radical change with the rise of classical Newtonian physics, its defeat of the Aristotelian world view, and the subsequent development of the Newtonian worldview into the reigning paradigm.  Not only did classical physics change our views concerning the nature and structure of physical reality, replacing an Aristotelian organismic view of nature with a “mechanistic” one, it also changed the conceptual categories through which we think about the world.  Even more than this, it changed our views about the nature and existence of God, of the self, and society;  even the historical development of modern music and art was not immune from its influence.”<label for="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote"><em>The World View of Contemporary Physics</em>, Richard Kitchener, p. 4</span>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The classical view presumes that observation does not alter the system being observed and that the evolution of physical systems is entirely governed by pre-existing conditions. Everything&mdash; galaxy
formation, what we perceive as conscious thoughts, and everything in
between&mdash; is, at least in principle, fully predictable with sufficient
knowledge of preceding conditions. We are conceived as observers of a reality that unfolds independently of our presence or participation.</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow summarized it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Classical science is based on the belief that there exists a real external world whose properties are definite and independent of the observer who perceives them. According to classical science, certain objects exist and have physical properties, such as speed and mass, that have well-defined values. In this view our theories are attempts to describe those objects and their properties, and our measurements and perceptions correspond to them. Both observer and observed are parts of a world that has an objective existence, and any distinction between them has no meaningful significance. In other words, if you see a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parking garage, it is because there really is a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parking garage. All other observers who look will measure the same properties, and the herd will have those properties whether anyone observes them or not. In philosophy that belief is called realism.”<label for="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<p>Hillary Putnam simply said &ldquo;&hellip;the world consists of some fixed totality of mind-independent objects. There is exactly one true and complete description of &rsquo;the way the world is&rsquo;&ldquo;<label for="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

And, as Jerry Coyne says in The Atheist&rsquo;s Guide to Reality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Physics is causally closed and causally complete. The only causes in
the universe are physical, and everything in the universe that has a
cause has a physical cause. In fact, we can go further and confidently
assert that the physical facts fix all the facts.<label for="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this view, there is no room for free will or any non-physical force
or influence. The emergence of life is a random and, most likely, an
extremely rare occurrence&mdash; and when life does emerge it evolves in a
completely blind manner. This perspective holds that science is the only valid means of gaining objective knowledge about the world. Concepts such as mind and consciousness are
human constructs and purely derivative from physical conditions,
different in degree and outcome but not in type from any other physical
interactions.</p>
<p>This set of ideas is the foundation of the scientific worldview that
through the end of the 19th century was almost universally accepted as
being true, or, as academic philosophers sometimes say, as having
ontological primacy.<label for="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-8" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">&ldquo;Ontological primacy&rdquo; is used here in the general sense of a  fundamental truth about the nature of the world, a conclusion that physics was widely thought to be solely responsible for (and for some contemporary scientists and philosophers, still is).</span>
 Newton connected us to the cosmos by showing
that the same principles or laws applied to both planets and everyday
objects. Maxwell unified magnetism, electricity, and light in a set of
common field equations. Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution extended the
conception of a lawful universe into the domain of biology. But none of
those expansions changed the underlying presumption of an objectively
real, purely physical, external world with definite properties that are
independent of any observer.</p>
<p>Modern science often proceeds from the assumption that nothing exists that cannot, at least in principle, be measured.
That includes consciousness
and all the subjective phenomena that derive from it. Spirit, meaning,
and other qualitative notions, they&rsquo;re all just electrochemical
reactions in our brain. Reality is purely physical, full stop. Feelings
of connection to something greater than ourselves such as sense of awe
or spirit are typically dismissed as evolutionary byproducts or emotional illusions without any objective significance.</p>
<p>By the early 20th century, however, this paradigm began to show cracks—notably in physics, psychology, and philosophy—as new findings challenged the very notions of objectivity, determinism, and materialism that classical science had taken for granted. The discoveries of quantum physics led to the recognition that classical physics was incomplete and to Wolfgang Pauli&rsquo;s more sweeping directive, that &ldquo;The most important and also the most difficult task of our time consists in working on the construction of a new idea of reality.&rdquo;
