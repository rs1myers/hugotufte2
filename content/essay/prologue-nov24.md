# PROLOGUE: QUESTIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

In the summer of 2018, a young orca named Tahlequah gave birth in the waters off the Pacific Northwest. When her calf died within hours, she did something that captivated millions around the world. Using her rostrum and flippers, she carried her baby's body through the ocean for seventeen days and over a thousand miles, refusing to let go. She balanced the small corpse on her head as she swam, dove to retrieve it when it slipped away, and pushed it gently through the waves while her pod waited, watched, and accompanied her in what could credibly be called a funeral procession.

The images spread rapidly across social media and news outlets. People everywhere followed her story, many moved to tears by something they recognized immediately and viscerally. They saw a mother's love, a parent's refusal to accept loss—an expression of mourning that felt intimately familiar despite emanating from a being whose world we can scarcely imagine. For seventeen days, millions of us shared in Tahlequah's vigil, connecting emotionally to what she seemed to be experiencing as she pushed through the waves to the point of exhaustion.

Some commentators dismissed this response as mere anthropomorphism—we were projecting human emotions onto animal behavior, interpreting it as grief when we had no evidence that orcas grieve as we do. Zoologist and author Jules Howard wrote:
>Pedantic (and blunt) as it sounds, if you believe J35 was displaying evidence of mourning or grief, you are making a case that rests on faith not on scientific endeavour, and that makes me uncomfortable as a scientist.{{< sidenote >}}Jules Howard, "The 'grieving' orca mother? Projecting emotions on animals is a sad mistake," The Guardian, August 14, 2018. "Tahlequah" is the name given by a local maritime museum; J35 is the name used by many academic researchers. {{< /sidenote >}}

But researchers who study animal behavior strongly challenged that view. As Barbara King, a biological anthropologist who has studied animal grief for years put it:

>"I am as sure as I can be in a scientific framework that there's an expression here of her sorrow. We know by now that animal joy, animal sorrow, animal fear, animal happiness, animal grief, the whole gamut exists. So these emotions don't (just) belong to humans."{{< sidenote >}}Canadian Press, January 18, 2025 Barbara King. {{< /sidenote >}} 

Mark Bekoff, a behavioral ecologist, put it even more directly:

> There is no doubt that many animals experience rich and deep emotions. It's not a matter of if emotions have evolved in animals but why they have evolved as they have. We must never forget that our emotions are the gifts of our ancestors, our animal kin. We have feelings and so do other animals.{{< sidenote >}}Mark Bekoff, "Grief, Mourning, and Broken Hearted Animals," *Psychology Today*, November 26, 2011. https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/animal-emotions/201111/grief-mourning-and-broken-hearted-animals {{< /sidenote >}}
 
These conflicting interpretations reveal something deeper than disagreement about animal behavior—they expose fundamental differences in how we think about consciousness and how it has evolved on Earth. The facts—Tahlequah's seventeen-day vigil, her physical exhaustion, her pod's accompanying presence—are not in dispute. But how we interpret those facts, what we think they mean, reflects one of the most consequential questions we face: Is rich and complex consciousness a unique evolutionary accident in *Homo sapiens*, or might other species have evolved consciousness similarly rich, even if utterly alien to us?

The presumption of human superiority runs deep in Western thought, shaping how decision-makers in industrialized society relate to the natural world. This presumption appears in both dominant narratives of our time: traditional theism, which places humans at the apex of divine creation, and the modern secular view, which treats consciousness as an accidental byproduct of recent evolutionary history. Though grounded in opposing metaphysics, both narratives converge on the same assumption: that human consciousness—particularly our capacities for abstraction and technology—represents the pinnacle of consciousness on earth, if not the cosmos.

But what if this assumption is wrong? What if mind{{< sidenote >}} Or any similar term, such as spirit or Tao. {{< /sidenote >}} is not an accident but a fundamental aspect of nature itself? What if Earth has been home for millions of years to species whose consciousness is as rich as ours but organized according to completely different principles? And what if we're destroying these beings without ever recognizing what we're losing?

## An Anomaly That Demands Attention

Tahlequah is an orca, one of approximately 75 species of odontocetes—toothed whales that include dolphins, porpoises, and sperm whales. These beings have thrived in Earth's oceans for tens of millions of years. Tahlequah's brain weighs about five kilograms, more than three times the mass of a typical human brain. Her ancestors possessed brains of similar size five million years ago, when our earliest proto-human ancestors were just beginning to walk upright in Africa.

This is not a minor curiosity. Multiple species of odontocetes evolved and maintained large, metabolically expensive brains along independent lineages and across geological time—representing what may be earth's longest-running experiment in complex neural architecture. Sperm whales brains weigh up to nine kilograms—six times larger than ours—as they have for fifteen million years. Pilot whales possess more than 37 billion neurons, more than twice the human count. Large brains are metabolically expensive: human brains consume roughly twenty percent of our metabolic energy despite representing only two percent of our body weight—an enormous biological commitment. Many cetacean species made similar investments and have maintained them for millions of years.

Why? If consciousness is merely an accidental byproduct of neural complexity, as the standard materialist story suggests, why would evolution repeatedly invest in and sustain such metabolically-intensive brain tissue? What purpose does all that neural architecture serve?

Behavioral evidence compounds the puzzle. Dolphins comprehend abstract concepts like "same" and "different." They recognize themselves in mirrors—a capacity once thought unique to humans, great apes, and elephants--and can report their own uncertainty during cognitive tasks---forms of metacognition that suggests genuine self-awareness. They understand both symbolic gestures and grammatical structure in ways that challenge our definitions of language. Odontocetes maintain distinct cultures and transmit cultural values through generations. And they demonstrate social bonding and networking rivaling that of humans.

Researchers in a 30-year study in coastal Australia have documented alliance networks among bottlenose dolphins that span hundreds of individuals across decades. These are not simple cooperative relationships but sophisticated, multi-tiered coalitions requiring individuals to track not just their own allies, but their allies' allies, navigating political landscapes that shift over years. Orcas maintain distinct cultural traditions—different hunting techniques, vocal dialects, and social practices—that are transmitted across generations and never shared even with neighboring populations whose territories overlap. Sperm whales, with their enormous brains, produce complex patterns of clicks—codas—that function as cultural markers, with different clans maintaining different repertoires across ocean basins.

Sound is the primary means by which odontocetes navigate, communicate, and perceive their world. Imagine living in their underwater world: you can see, but only dimly in the murky and deep water. Instead of vision, you "see" objects with precise acoustic signals you emit, an extremely sophisticated biosonar that reveals not only highly-detailed exterior forms but also interior structures. Moreover, the mental images of the world around you are fully three-dimensional, formed not only from your own biosonar emissions, but also from your nearby conspecifics (members of the same species) who are simultaneously generating their own acoustic imagery. You navigate, locate food, play with each other and conduct your entire life in this cacophony of acoustic signals. At the same time, you're using different acoustic signals to communicate with others. Your social environment is complex: you form and dissolve alliances with dozens of individuals and maintain multi-tiered relationships over the course of decades. Any communication can be heard by everyone within acoustic range.  There are no secrets in the world of dolphins. 

What would it be like to live in such a radically different sensory world? While we cannot fully know the subjective nature of their consciousness, we know enough to conclude that many large-brained species have lives with many of the same characteristics as humans. They recognize themselves as individuals and follow cultural norms  that are passed down through generations. They communicate in ways we are only beginning to understand and navigate social landscapes of remarkable complexity.  And they have been doing all of this for millions of years longer than humans have existed.

Neurobiologist Harry Jerison, whose pioneering work on brain evolution we'll explore in detail later, proposed that highly encephalized{{< sidenote >}}Jerison used the term "encephalized" to represent brains that were larger than expected for a given body size—what he called 'excess brain tissue.' We'll explore this concept and its implications further in Chapter 4.{{< /sidenote >}} brains don't merely process information—they actively construct species-specific realities. Biologists refer to these realities as the *umwelt*,{{< sidenote >}}*Umwelt* is the term coined by Jakob von Uexküll, an early-20th century biologist {{< /sidenote >}} the subjective world an animal experiences. Contemporary neuroscience supports this insight through predictive processing and perceptual inference: brains continuously build and update internal models of the world, creating the reality an animal experiences.  This applies to all animals, but the experienced worlds of large-brained species are far more complex because they have vastly greater information-processing capacities. When species with such capacities also occupy fundamentally different sensory environments—acoustic three-dimensional ocean vs. visual terrestrial landscape—the resulting experiences are bound to be completely alien to each other.

Alien forms of consciousness are not necessarily primitive or inferior; they are just organized according to completely different principles. The neural architecture of odontocetes, both similar to and different from human brains, appears to have evolved to process types of information that have no human parallel: simultaneous, acoustic cognition of objects, social, and environmental information.

Researchers in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program have pointed out that technology is not the only measure of intelligence, and cautioned that a techno-centric bias could prevent us from recognizing highly-intelligent forms of life that never built sophisticated tools.{{< sidenote >}}Shostak, Seth. *Confessions of an Alien Hunter*,National Geographic Books, 2009 {{< /sidenote >}} Laurance Doyle argues that the complexity and opacity of cetacean communication closely mirrors what we could expect from extraterrestrial intelligence.{{< sidenote >}}Laurance R. Doyle, Brenda McCowan, Simon Johnston, Sean F. Hanser, "Information theory, animal communication, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence," Acta Astronautica, Volume 68, Issues 3–4, 2011 {{< /sidenote >}}

The possibility emerges that these beings—stable across millions of years, possessing brains as large or larger than ours and demonstrating sophisticated social and cognitive abilities—might be our equals in consciousness in a sort of cosmic equivalence. Although very different from us, they may represent another evolutionary path to complex awareness, one that is neither inferior nor superior to that of humans, just fundamentally different. It's a possibility the modern scientific worldview makes almost invisible, because that framework assumes consciousness emerged accidentally from human-style neural complexity and abstraction. But what if consciousness is not an accident? What if it's a fundamental dimension of reality that can be expressed in radically different forms?

## The Framework Problem

If the possibility of cosmic equivalence seems radical or implausible, that reaction itself is worth examining. Why does it feel so counterintuitive? Perhaps because we've inherited a framework—a way of understanding reality—that makes such possibilities difficult to see. If consciousness is merely an evolutionary accident—if the materialist story is complete—then cetacean extinction is tragic but not cosmically significant. But if the evidence pointing toward an equivalence of interiority is valid—if cetacean beings possess a form of consciousness potentially as rich as our own—then in their destruction we may be committing one of the great moral catastrophes of history---a tragedy that our inherited framework prevents us from recognizing. We may be destroying peers, perhaps even teachers whose long existence offers lessons about sustainable intelligence, without recognizing them.

So much then depends on one's worldview, or the story one lives within. Psychologist Mark Koltko-Rivera defines a worldview as "a way of describing the universe and life within it, both in terms of what is and what ought to be." It is a conceptual framework that informs our perception of many topics, including "human nature, the meaning of life, and the composition of the universe itself."{{< sidenote >}}The Psychology of Worldviews, Mark E. Koltko-Rivera{{< /sidenote >}} Koltko-Rivera holds that each of us has a worldview, even when unconsciously held, as we cannot interpret reality without one.  

In later sections we'll further explore the idea of worldviews in the context of the human *umwelt* as well as a deliberate choice of perspective. We'll also consider how the modern scientific worldview has become so entrenched that for most scientists it is not merely one perspective among many, but rather the only possible framework by which a complete description of reality can eventually be accomplished. Underlying this belief is the presumption that the universe is independent of observation or participation, that a  canonical reality can at least in principle be fully understood through logic and measurement. The only alternative, in this view, requires something akin to mysticism---and mysticism is a third-rail in scientific discourse. 

There are several variations of this perspective, collectively referred to as scientific realism and held as truth by the majority of contemporary scientists and philosophers. As we'll see in Chapters 3 and 4, however, findings of the quantum nature of matter have led some of them to conclude that scientific realism cannot provide a complete accounting for consciousness and all that stems from it. 

 The scientific framework, however, is a fluid set of metaphors as well as descriptions. Indeed, Lakoff and Johnson argue that there is no fully objective point of view, and that the world revealed by science is constrained by available metaphors.{{< sidenote >}}George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, *The Metaphors We Live By*{{< /sidenote >}}

Modern cognitive science has shown that human beings do not merely use metaphors; we think through them. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argue that metaphors are not decorative language but the basic neural and conceptual structures that allow us to make sense of the world. At the level of the brain, metaphors function as mappings from concrete bodily experience—movement, balance, warmth, light—onto more abstract domains such as emotion, morality, time, and meaning. They are the deep grammar of interpretation.

This means that the stories we live within are not optional narratives we layer on top of facts. They are the architectural frameworks that determine which facts we notice, which we ignore, and what we take those facts to mean. A metaphor like “seeing is knowing” shapes everything from religious visions to scientific observation. A metaphor like “time is a resource” underlies entire economic systems. And a metaphor like “the universe is a machine” governs what modern culture treats as real, knowable, and important.

This is why Tahlequah’s vigil provoked such conflicting responses. The disagreement was not about behavior or data; it was about the metaphors that structure our interpretations. To see the world through the metaphor of mechanism is to interpret her actions as biological reflex. To see it through metaphors of relationship or interiority is to interpret it as grief. Neither interpretation is simply “the facts.” Both reflect the cognitive frameworks we inhabit. The challenge—and the opportunity—is to examine the over-arching metaphors and be deliberate in which one(s) we choose to live by.

## Living As If: Choosing a Worldview

We cannot prove that Tahlequah was genuinely grieving, as we cannot access her subjective experience. Nor can we prove that consciousness is fundamental rather than emergent, that cetaceans are our cognitive or experiential equals, or that mind is woven into the fabric of reality rather than being a late-arriving accident of evolution. We cannot prove any of these things with the kind of certainty we might wish for.

And yet, for seventeen days, millions of people responded to Tahlequah as if her grief were real, as if her consciousness mattered as much as ours, as if the connection we felt across species boundaries revealed something true about the nature of reality. They lived, briefly, within a different framework—one that recognized consciousness in another form, that acknowledged kinship beyond our species, that treated experience as real and significant regardless of whether it could be mathematically measured or scientifically proven.

What if we lived that way all the time? What if when we looked at an orca or a dolphin we saw not just a remarkable marine mammal but a being with a fundamentally different but no less rich sense of experience than ours? Would it change how we relate to cetaceans, to the natural world, and perhaps to each other?

This book is built on a simple but consequential claim: in the absence of metaphysical certainty about the nature of consciousness and reality, we must choose a framework to live within. The question is not only "Is it true?" but "What happens if we live as if it were true?" All worldviews, including the one that dominates contemporary thought, are maps of reality—not reality itself. They are useful fictions, ways of organizing experience and guiding action. The question is not which map is absolutely true, but which map or framework serves us better.

This is not relativism; not all frameworks are equally good. Some lead to flourishing, connection, and sustainable ways of being. Others lead to destruction, alienation, and existential crisis. We can evaluate worldviews by their consequences—psychological, ethical, existential, practical. We can ask: What kind of world does this framework create? What possibilities does it make visible or invisible? What does it mean for how we treat other beings, ourselves, and the living systems that sustain us?

The modern scientific worldview has given us unprecedented power over the physical world—medicine, technology, the ability to predict and manipulate natural processes with remarkable precision. These are genuine achievements that any credible alternative must acknowledge and preserve. But this same worldview has also contributed to a crisis of meaning, a pervasive sense of alienation from nature and from each other, and a trajectory that appears to be leading toward ecological catastrophe.

What if we're working within a framework that makes some crucial things invisible? What if consciousness is not an anomaly to be explained away but a fundamental dimension of reality that our current map systematically excludes? What if the possibility of cosmic equivalence—that we share this planet with beings who are our cognitive peers—is real, but our framework prevents us from recognizing it?

This book invites you to experiment with living as if consciousness were fundamental rather than derivative—not as an article of faith, but as a working hypothesis whose consequences we can observe and evaluate.

## What Lies Ahead

This exploration unfolds in four parts, each examining our central questions from different angles. The structure is intentionally holographic—key themes will spiral and return, each time revealing new facets and connections.

Part I examines how we got here—how the participatory cosmos of our ancestors gave way to the mechanical universe of modern science, and why this transformation, however productive, may have been incomplete. We'll trace the historical arc from a world alive with meaning and purpose to one that treats consciousness as an uncomfortable anomaly, and we'll see why the modern scientific worldview, despite its genuine achievements, struggles to accommodate the very minds that constructed it.

Part II presents evidence that doesn't fit comfortably within the inherited framework. We'll examine cetacean neuroscience and behavior in detail, exploring what their massive, ancient brains and sophisticated social lives might reveal about the nature of consciousness. We'll also look at quantum mechanics and mind-body phenomena—domains where the purely physical description seems incomplete, where consciousness appears to play a role that mechanistic models cannot easily explain.

Part III develops the philosophical alternative. Drawing on thinkers from William James to Alfred North Whitehead to contemporary philosophers of consciousness, we'll construct a framework that treats consciousness as fundamental rather than derivative, that sees reality as both physical and experiential, that makes room for meaning and purpose without requiring supernatural intervention.

Part IV explores what it means to live within this framework. What are the ethical implications if cetaceans might be our equals? What changes existentially when consciousness becomes primary rather than secondary? How do we navigate life holding our metaphysical commitments lightly while still allowing them to guide us? This is about practice, about bringing philosophy down from abstraction into the texture of daily life.

Throughout, certain themes will spiral and return: the possibility of cosmic equivalence between humans and cetaceans, the contrast between experiential and abstractive modes of being, the meaning crisis afflicting modern culture, and the vision of a participatory cosmos in which we belong rather than merely exist. These themes will deepen and connect as we progress, each examination revealing new facets of the central question.

## Notes on Certainty and Consequence

These ideas may prove wrong. What's offered here is a framework, not truth—consciousness as fundamental, cetaceans as our cosmic peers, the universe as participatory rather than mechanistic. One possible map of a territory we all inhabit but none of us fully understand.

But the modern scientific worldview is also a choice, not a proven truth. It too is a map, not the territory. It is one interpretive framework among others, and despite its genuine achievements and undeniable utility in certain domains, it may be incomplete in ways that matter profoundly—psychologically, ethically, existentially, and practically.

Critics sometimes demand: "Is your framework falsifiable? Is it scientific?" But this question itself reveals an assumption worth examining. The life sciences—biology, ecology, evolutionary theory—have succeeded magnificently not primarily through falsifiable predictions but through narrative coherence, pattern recognition, and explanatory power. Most of biology's major breakthroughs came through accident and experiment rather than theoretical prediction. Yet we rightly consider evolutionary biology rigorous science, judged by whether its narratives make sense of the evidence, generate productive research, and prove practically useful. The framework offered here asks to be evaluated by those same pragmatic criteria—not by a standard that biology itself doesn't consistently meet.

The alternative proposed here deserves serious consideration—not because it's certainly true, but because the consequences of living within it might be significantly better. Better for our relationship with the natural world. Better for the possibility of recognizing and preserving forms of consciousness that took millions of years to evolve. Better for addressing the crisis of meaning that haunts modern culture despite our material prosperity. Better for creating a future in which technological power is guided by wisdom rather than leading to self-destruction.

If we're destroying beings who are our cognitive equals—if the possibility of cosmic equivalence is real—then we are committing one of the great moral catastrophes of history, and doing so blindly, prevented from seeing what we're doing by the very framework we've inherited for making sense of the world. This is not an academic issue. It's urgent; it's highly consequential; and it demands a response.

## The Invitation

Tahlequah still swims in those waters. Her species faces existential threats from changes we have made to her world. The evidence—both the cetacean findings and the meaning crisis we ourselves experience—demands a response.

For seventeen days in the summer of 2018, we lived as if her grief were real, as if her consciousness mattered as much as ours, as if the connection we felt across species boundaries revealed something true about the nature of existence. What if we never stopped living that way? What if we allowed that recognition to reshape how we understand consciousness, how we relate to the natural world, how we interpret our place in the cosmos?

This book asks you to consider that possibility. Not as dogma to be believed, but as an experiment to be lived. Not as a rejection of science, but as an expansion of what we consider natural. Not as a return to pre-modern superstition, but as a move forward to a more complete understanding that integrates scientific rigor with the dimensions of meaning and consciousness that the modern scientific worldview has systematically excluded.

The choice is yours. The universe may be watching through our eyes to see what we decide.
