# PROLOGUE: QUESTIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

In the summer of 2018, a young orca named Tahlequah{{< sidenote >}}Tahlequah was the name given by The Whale Museum in Friday Harbor, Washington through their Adopt-a-Whale program. Marine biologists refer to her as "J35".{{< /sidenote >}} gave birth in the waters off the Pacific Northwest. When her calf died within hours, she did something that captivated millions around the world. Using her rostrum and flippers, she carried her baby's body through the ocean for seventeen days and over a thousand miles, refusing to let go. She balanced the small corpse on her head as she swam, dove to retrieve it when it slipped away, and pushed it gently through the waves while her pod waited, watched, and accompanied her in what could credibly be called a funeral procession.

The images spread rapidly across social media and news outlets. People everywhere followed her story, many moved to tears by something they recognized immediately and viscerally. They saw a mother's love, a parent's refusal to accept loss—an expression of mourning that felt intimately familiar despite emanating from a being whose world we can scarcely imagine. For seventeen days, millions of us shared in Tahlequah's vigil, connecting emotionally to what she seemed to be experiencing as she pushed through the waves to the point of exhaustion.

Some commentators dismissed this response as mere anthropomorphism—we were projecting human emotions onto animal behavior, interpreting it as grief when, they argued, we had no evidence that orcas grieve as we do. Zoologist and author Jules Howard wrote:

> Pedantic (and blunt) as it sounds, if you believe J35 was displaying evidence of mourning or grief, you are making a case that rests on faith not on scientific endeavour, and that makes me uncomfortable as a scientist.{{< sidenote >}}Jules Howard, "The 'grieving' orca mother? Projecting emotions on animals is a sad mistake," *The Guardian*, August 14, 2018.{{< /sidenote >}}

Other researchers who study animal behavior strongly challenged Howard's view. As Barbara King, a biological anthropologist who has studied animal grief for years, put it:

> I am as sure as I can be in a scientific framework that there's an expression here of her sorrow. We know by now that animal joy, animal sorrow, animal fear, animal happiness, animal grief, the whole gamut exists. So these emotions don't (just) belong to humans.{{< sidenote >}}Canadian Press, January 18, 2025, quoting Barbara King.{{< /sidenote >}}

Mark Bekoff, a behavioral ecologist, put it even more directly:

> There is no doubt that many animals experience rich and deep emotions. It's not a matter of if emotions have evolved in animals but why they have evolved as they have. We must never forget that our emotions are the gifts of our ancestors, our animal kin. We have feelings and so do other animals.{{< sidenote >}}Mark Bekoff, "Grief, Mourning, and Broken-Hearted Animals," *Psychology Today*, November 26, 2011.{{< /sidenote >}}
 
These conflicting interpretations reveal something deeper than a disagreement about animal behavior—they expose fundamental differences in how we think about consciousness and how it has evolved on Earth. The facts—Tahlequah's seventeen-day vigil, her physical exhaustion, her pod's accompanying presence—are not in dispute. But how we interpret those facts, what we think they mean, reflects one of the most consequential questions we face: Is rich and complex consciousness a unique evolutionary accident in *Homo sapiens*, or might other species have evolved forms of consciousness that are similarly rich, even if utterly alien to us?
 
Most contemporary scientists and philosophers have historically held, at least implicitly, an approximate equivalence between mind and intelligence, and that they roughly correlate with the capacity for abstraction. Tahlequah, in this view, might possess emotion, but humans are unique because we alone possess the 'higher' faculty of complex abstraction. That view, however, has been shown to be untenable by recent, extraordinary developments in machine intelligence. 

## The End of One Kind of Progress

In 2024, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the creators of AlphaFold, an artificial intelligence system developed by Google DeepMind. The award was well-deserved. For decades, biologists had struggled with the "protein folding problem"—the challenge of predicting how a protein's one-dimensional chain of amino acids curls into the complex three-dimensional shapes that sustain life. The problem was immensely complex—by some estimates involving more possible configurations than there are atoms in the observable universe. AlphaFold largely overcame the challenge. And in doing so, it did far more than perform brute-force calculation; it demonstrated a form of abstraction and pattern recognition that rivals, and in narrowly defined technical terms exceeds, human capabilities. 

If abstraction is the crowning achievement of human existence, as much of modern science and philosophy presumes, we may have already created our successor. 

AlphaFold's capabilities are extraordinary, by historical standards almost godlike. It can manipulate data, simulate biological reality, and produce answers that will revolutionize medicine and save countless human lives. Yet, despite its brilliance, AlphaFold felt nothing when it won the Nobel Prize. It felt no pride in its achievement, no curiosity about the proteins it folded, and no care for the patients it might help save. It has no interior world. It is a triumph of intelligence without consciousness—a system that can potentially do everything, yet experiences nothing.

Tahlequah, by contrast, is an experiential being. She cannot solve the protein folding problem. She cannot perform calculus or model the climate. But she possesses something AlphaFold lacks entirely. She understands loss, she navigates the delicate politics of her pod, she teaches her young, and she acts with a sense of responsibility toward her kin. We infer this 'participatory knowing' from the same evidence we use to infer consciousness in other humans: behavioral sophistication, emotional expression, social complexity. Her life is not a simulation; it is a felt experience, rich with connection and consequence. She is, in this sense, a fellow sentient being, albeit in a world largely unavailable to human understanding.

But who is Tahlequah? What does her kind represent? To understand the stakes of what we're discussing requires recognizing what cetaceans actually are—and how profoundly they challenge our assumptions about consciousness itself.

## Evolution's Other Experiment

Tahlequah is an orca, one of approximately 90 cetacean species—toothed and baleen whales that represent evolution's only fully oceanic mammals. Many toothed-whale species (odontocetes) possess remarkably large brains: sperm whales have the largest brains on Earth, reaching about eight kilograms—roughly six times human brain mass. Orca brains weigh around five kilograms, and several other odontocete species exceed humans in absolute brain size. More remarkably, they have been this way for tens of millions of years—Tahlequah's ancestors achieved their large brains long before the earliest proto-humans walked upright. Unlike large terrestrial mammals, these lineages have remained morphologically stable, with evolutionary change expressed primarily through social organization, behavior, and culture.

Why? If consciousness is merely an accidental byproduct of neural complexity, as the standard materialist story suggests, why would evolution repeatedly invest in and sustain such metabolically intensive brain tissue? What purpose does all that neural architecture serve?

A complete answer is of course complex and out of reach. But many cetaceans exhibit behaviors similar to large-brained terrestrial species. Dolphins comprehend abstract concepts like "same" and "different." They recognize themselves in mirrors—a capacity once thought unique to humans, great apes, and elephants—and can report their own uncertainty during cognitive tasks, forms of metacognition that suggest genuine self-awareness. They understand both symbolic gestures and grammatical structure in ways that challenge our human-centric definitions of language. Orcas maintain distinct cultural traditions—different hunting techniques, vocal dialects, and social practices—transmitted across generations and never shared even with neighboring populations whose territories overlap. Sperm whales, with their enormous brains, produce complex acoustic patterns—codas—that function as cultural markers, with different clans maintaining different repertoires across ocean basins.

Researchers in a 30-year study in coastal Australia have documented alliance networks among bottlenose dolphins spanning hundreds of individuals over decades. These are not simple cooperative relationships but sophisticated, multi-tiered coalitions requiring individuals to track not just their own allies, but their allies' allies, navigating political landscapes that shift over years.

Cetaceans are the most extreme case of a broader pattern of convergent intelligence. Cephalopods diverged from vertebrates over 500 million years ago and evolved a fundamentally different neural architecture with no central nervous system, but they demonstrate substantial experiential depth. Corvids and parrots developed remarkable cognition with distinctly different brain architectures. Elephant brains, by far the largest of terrestrial animals, evolved well before and along completely different lines than primates.  Great apes have demonstrated self-awareness and even metacognitive monitoring, realizing they don't know something.

The pattern  suggests that rich sentience—subjective experience, the felt quality of being—is not a human monopoly but an outcome that evolution has realized multiple times. Large-brained cetaceans, however, appear to provide a clear illustration of this pattern. Remarkably, even within odontocetes, multiple distinct lineages independently evolved large brains and sophisticated sentience—sperm whales, orcas, and various dolphin families each represent separate evolutionary experiments in experiential depth within an alien acoustic environment.

The acoustic world of the odontocetes is indeed an alien environment, fundamentally unlike our visual, terrestrial experience. They navigate, hunt, and communicate through sophisticated biosonar, perceiving three-dimensional acoustic imagery and interior structures invisible to sight. Their *umwelt*—the subjective world they experience—is so radically different from ours that fully accessing their consciousness may be impossible. 

We know enough to recognize that the odontocetes umwelt, what neurobiologist Harry Jerison called species-specific reality, is primarily acoustic—creating a perceptual world shared among all individuals within acoustic range. Jerison expanded on this idea with a profound possibility: that odontocetes might simultaneously experience both individual selfhood and a collective awareness shared across the group—a form of consciousness as alien to our experience as echolocation itself.{{< sidenote >}}Jerison, H. J. (1986). "The Perceptual Worlds of Dolphins." In R. J. Schusterman, J. A. Thomas, & F. G. Wood (Eds.), *Dolphin Cognition and Behavior: Comparative Research* (pp. 141-166). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.{{< /sidenote >}}

These beings—stable across millions of years, possessing brains as large or larger than ours, demonstrating sophisticated social and cognitive abilities—may have developed forms of awareness as deep and meaningful as ours, organized by completely different principles. We cannot directly access cetacean consciousness any more than we can access other human minds. We infer human consciousness from neural complexity and behavioral sophistication—evidence that applies equally, often more strongly, to cetaceans. The burden falls on skeptics to explain why this inference should fail for beings with larger brains and longer evolutionary histories. They may be our sentient equals, with comparable richness and depth of interior experience, albeit realized through neural architectures fundamentally different from ours.

Industrial civilization has been devastating for these remarkable beings. Millions of whales were slaughtered for their oil over the past few centuries—for lighting streets and homes prior to electrical power, and later to lubricate high-performance motors and machinery. We literally rendered down the bodies of highly sentient beings to grease the gears of our industrial machines. Populations of many species were reduced to just a few percent of their historic levels. Several may yet go extinct; others will take centuries to recover.

## What This Reveals About Human Progress

Understanding what cetaceans represent fundamentally reframes AlphaFold's achievement—and exposes the trajectory humans have been following for centuries.

AlphaFold marks an inflection point in human history—not because machines became conscious, but because they revealed the limits of what abstraction alone can achieve. For centuries, we invested in developing technological capability and mathematical description, treating reality as a machine to be explained in human-comprehensible terms. We succeeded brilliantly. We have solved the mysteries of atomic structure, traced the history of the universe back to its origin, and landed rovers on Mars. But technology has now diverged into a separate existence—a distinct lineage that now out-competes biological intelligence in its own domain. Machines match or exceed human capabilities in abstraction, calculation, pattern recognition, and symbolic manipulation. What we thought made us special—complex abstraction and technological prowess—turns out to be at least partially replicable in silicon, and the silicon version surpasses the biological one.

Abstraction is a powerful but narrow adaptation. It excels at manipulation and prediction, enabling genuine technological achievements we must acknowledge and preserve. But abstraction remains silent about meaning, value, and responsibility. It can calculate optimal outcomes without caring which outcome matters. It can model biological processes without experiencing what it's like to be alive. This asymmetry—instrumental power coupled with existential emptiness—defines both its utility and its limits.

This success exposes a deeper question:  If machines can handle abstraction and manipulation—and increasingly do it better than we can—what remains for biological consciousness to cultivate? Can we pivot from our obsession with technological abstractions towards a richer sense of interiority and recognition that we are participants in an immense web of consciousness? 

Historically, humans understood the world as a living whole, investigated through multiple modes of knowing—empirical observation, contemplative practice, phenomenological insight, mythological understanding. Different wisdom traditions—from indigenous cosmologies to Buddhist phenomenology to Christian theology—developed sophisticated frameworks for understanding consciousness, meaning, and right relationship. Over the last few centuries, however, Western civilization became driven by a singular imperative: to explain the world in terms the human mind can comprehend—to build models and theories that make reality intelligible, not merely predictable. That integrated vision gave way to a mechanistic metaphor described exclusively through mathematics—a deliberate strategy to make the universe graspable and controllable. This shift enabled unprecedented power to predict and manipulate matter—genuine achievements we must acknowledge and preserve. But it also fragmented our understanding, reducing consciousness to epiphenomenon, meaning to illusion, and moral obligation to social construction.

We developed technological tools to serve this explanatory project—machines to help us calculate, model, and understand. But technology has diverged from that purpose. AlphaFold represents this divergence perfectly: it achieves breakthroughs through processes that remain opaque even to its creators. It works brilliantly without providing human-comprehensible explanations of how. The tool we built to help us understand has decoupled from understanding itself.

We've reached the limits of abstraction-centered progress—at least for biological intelligence.{{< sidenote >}}This isn't claiming humans will never improve at mathematics or logic, but that machines now surpass us in these domains and the gap will only widen. The trajectory of biological consciousness developing greater abstractive capability has hit practical limits.{{< /sidenote >}} But the limit runs deeper than machines surpassing us technologically. Explanatory abstraction itself—the attempt to make reality comprehensible through abstract models—has divorced from its original purpose. Physicalist frameworks now defend frameworks requiring infinite unobservable entities as "parsimonious" while calling consciousness-as-fundamental "extravagant"—revealing that what's being protected is metaphysical commitment, not explanatory simplicity.{{< sidenote >}}We'll examine this specifically through the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics in a later chapter, where physicist Sean Carroll's defense of infinite universes as "parsimonious" while critiquing consciousness-as-fundamental frameworks reveals how completely the explanatory project has divorced from its stated principles.{{< /sidenote >}}

What remains is what we share with Tahlequah: consciousness itself, the felt interior of experience, participatory knowing that no arrangement of transistors can instantiate. And this reveals something profound: we've been over-developing one capacity while neglecting another. For centuries, we invested in abstraction and manipulation—precisely what machines now do better. We've barely begun cultivating experiential depth, participatory wisdom, the integration of knowledge types that only consciousness enables.

This is where cetaceans become crucial to understanding our situation. They have mastered forms of experiential development that humans have barely begun to explore. With their large brains stable for millions of years, they appear to have reached an evolutionarily sustainable strategy—sophisticated consciousness without technological manipulation, maintained across geological timescales. We cannot know what their subjective experience is like—their acoustic umwelt, their three-dimensional oceanic existence, their reality organized according to principles utterly unlike our own. But we know they demonstrate experiential depth, participatory knowing, and sustainable existence achieved without external manipulation of matter. They've had millions of years to refine their sense of self and, as Thomas Berry would say, their sense of place. They are an example of highly intelligent life that has learned to live in balance with their environment. They have already developed capacities we've barely begun to cultivate—the very capacities that become essential once abstraction reaches its limits.

Researchers in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program have noted that technology is not the only measure of intelligence, cautioning that techno-centric bias could prevent us from recognizing highly intelligent life that never built sophisticated tools. Cetaceans may represent exactly what SETI warns about: beings who developed experiential sophistication rather than technological manipulation. They show what's possible when evolution optimizes for participatory depth rather than abstract control.

This defines the central crisis of our time. We have built a civilization that worships the kind of intelligence AlphaFold possesses—the power of abstraction, manipulation, and control. We are building ever-more capable machines while systematically destroying highly-intelligent beings who embody what machines can never replicate. We place a high premium on knowledge but have a low regard for wisdom.

The danger is not that machines will become conscious. The danger is that we will continue to prioritize capability over wisdom, hollowing out our world until it is totally efficient, technologically advanced, and spiritually dead. Over the last several centuries we have gradually replaced mind with machine, and a quest for wisdom with an accumulation of knowledge. But we have failed to recognize that the capabilities machines now match—technological abstraction and manipulation—had nothing to do with moral obligation. What remains—what machines can never replicate—is consciousness itself, and with it, responsibility toward other conscious beings.

This trajectory of increasingly mechanizing the cosmos is the logical outcome of human exceptionalism, a presumption that runs deep in Western thought. This presumption appears in both dominant narratives of our time: traditional theism, which places humans at the apex of divine creation, and the modern secular view, which treats consciousness as an accidental byproduct of recent evolutionary history. Though grounded in opposing metaphysics, both converge on the same assumption: that human consciousness—particularly our capacities for abstraction and technology—represents the pinnacle of what consciousness can be.

I will argue that this assumption is wrong. Rich interiority and subjective experience—widely believed to be exclusively human—emerge naturally in a world where qualitative aspects are fundamental, not derivative. This framework has stronger explanatory value than physicalist reduction, readily accommodating the immense range of sentience present everywhere we look. A highly consequential conclusion follows: Earth has been home, for millions of years, to species whose inner lives are as rich as ours, organized according to completely different principles. And we're destroying these beings without recognizing what we're losing.

## Notes on Certainty and Consequence

This exploration unfolds in four parts: Part I examines how we arrived at the current mechanistic worldview and why it may be incomplete. Part II presents evidence that doesn't fit comfortably within that framework—cetacean neuroscience and behavior, quantum mechanics, mind-body phenomena. Part III develops the philosophical alternative, drawing on thinkers from William James to David Bohm to contemporary philosophers of consciousness, constructing a framework that treats consciousness as fundamental. Part IV explores what it means to live within this framework—the ethical implications, the existential shifts, the practice of bringing philosophy into daily life.

The ideas offered here may prove wrong. They are presented as a framework, not a revelation of ultimate truth. Consciousness as fundamental, cetaceans as our cosmic peers, the universe as participatory rather than mechanistic—these are elements of one possible map of a territory we all inhabit but none of us fully understand.

But the dominant scientific model is also a choice, not a proven truth. Despite its genuine achievements and undeniable utility in certain domains, it may be incomplete in ways that matter profoundly—psychologically, ethically, existentially, and practically.

The life sciences—biology, ecology, evolutionary theory—have succeeded magnificently not primarily through falsifiable predictions but through narrative coherence, pattern recognition, and explanatory power. Most of biology's major breakthroughs came through accident and experiment rather than theoretical prediction. The framework offered here asks to be evaluated by those same pragmatic criteria. It requires only a single additional assumption beyond physicalism: that consciousness and other non-material aspects are fundamental features of reality rather than emergent properties of matter. This one shift provides stronger explanatory value for phenomena physicalism struggles to accommodate: the hard problem of consciousness, the independent evolution of large brains across multiple lineages, the effectiveness of wisdom traditions across cultures, the felt sense of moral obligation among conscious beings.

The alternative proposed here deserves serious consideration—not because it's certainly true, but because the consequences of living within it might be significantly better. Better for our relationship with the natural world. Better for the possibility of recognizing and preserving forms of consciousness that took millions of years to evolve. Better for addressing the crisis of meaning that haunts modern culture despite our material prosperity. Better for creating a future in which technological power is guided by wisdom rather than leading to self-destruction.

Evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson argues that wisdom traditions evolved through cultural selection precisely because they worked—they enhanced cooperation, meaning-making, and group survival. The psychophysical continuum explains why: these traditions weren't inventing useful fictions; they reflect genuine features of how conscious beings relate to reality that physicalist reduction overlooks. 

This framework aligns with emerging consensus across disciplines. Neuroscientist Iain McGilchrist shows our brain's hemispheric architecture reflects fundamental reality—the left hemisphere fragments for manipulation and control, enabling technological prowess, while the right hemisphere grasps participatory wholeness, enabling wisdom and meaning. We've been operating primarily from the left hemisphere for centuries; McGilchrist argues the crisis we face stems from this imbalance. Cognitive scientist John Vervaeke demonstrates that wisdom requires 'participatory knowing'—direct engagement with reality, not just propositional knowledge about it. This is what machines lack and can never develop: the capacity for felt understanding that emerges from conscious participation. Physicist David Bohm argued that reality is 'undivided wholeness'—consciousness and matter as complementary aspects of what he called the implicate order, continuously unfolding and enfolding in dynamic process.

From neuroscience, cognitive science, and physics comes recognition: reality is participatory, consciousness is fundamental, fragmentation is pathology. The Modern Scientific Worldview's exclusive focus on the measurable and material represents fragmentation—treating part of reality (the physical) as the whole. The psychophysical continuum represents recovery of wholeness without abandoning scientific rigor.

Psychologist William R. Miller's book *Living As If* demonstrates this approach in practice. Miller, a distinguished scientist who pioneered evidence-based addiction treatment, describes living according to Christian faith while explicitly acknowledging 'people can live well and wisely from many different perspectives.' This is the stance advocated here: choose a framework that honors consciousness and meaning, commit to it genuinely, while recognizing others may choose differently. Not just philosophy but livable practice.

The burden of wisdom and responsibility falls exclusively on humans. Cetaceans haven't damaged their environment despite millions of years of evolution. We, with our unique combination of consciousness and technological power amplified by increasingly capable machines, must cultivate wisdom adequate to our capabilities. This isn't just a peripheral nicety—it's the center of our only viable path to sustainable participation in a reality that is far greater than us. 

## Who This Essay Is For

Not everyone engages questions of consciousness and cosmic responsibility at the same depth. Psychologist Abraham Maslow observed that some people experience "self-transcendence"—concern for values and beings beyond personal interest. This book is written for readers experiencing that pull—those who sense consciousness resists reduction to mechanism, who feel genuine obligation to other conscious beings, who seek naturalistic alternatives to physicalist reductionism.

If cetacean extinction feels like cosmic tragedy rather than mere ecological loss, if these questions feel urgent rather than abstract, if you've been seeking frameworks that take consciousness seriously without supernatural commitments—this book offers philosophical grounding for intuitions you're already having. You're not confused; you're perceiving dimensions of reality that expanded awareness makes visible.

## The Invitation

For seventeen days in 2018, millions recognized Tahlequah's grief as real, her consciousness as mattering as much as ours. This book argues we should live that way every day—not as sentimental gesture but as recognition of reality. It does not ask you to 'consider' possibilities, but rather to adopt a framework to live by. Not as dogma requiring certainty, but as pragmatic choice with better consequences than physicalist reduction. Not to reject science, but to recognize non-material aspects as fundamental—a single new assumption providing stronger explanatory value for consciousness, meaning, and moral reality.

The choice is yours. The universe may be watching through our eyes to see what we decide.
