# PROLOGUE: QUESTIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

In the summer of 2018, a young orca named Tahlequah gave birth in the waters off the Pacific Northwest. When her calf died within hours, she did something that captivated millions around the world. Using her rostrum and flippers, she carried her baby's body through the ocean for seventeen days and over a thousand miles, refusing to let go. She balanced the small corpse on her head as she swam, dove to retrieve it when it slipped away, and pushed it gently through the waves while her pod waited, watched, and accompanied her in what could credibly be called a funeral procession.

The images spread rapidly across social media and news outlets. People everywhere followed her story, many moved to tears by something they recognized immediately and viscerally. They saw a mother's love, a parent's refusal to accept loss—an expression of mourning that felt intimately familiar despite emanating from a being whose world we can scarcely imagine. For seventeen days, millions of us shared in Tahlequah's vigil, connecting emotionally to what she seemed to be experiencing as she pushed through the waves to the point of exhaustion.

Some commentators dismissed this response as mere anthropomorphism—we were projecting human emotions onto animal behavior, interpreting it as grief when we had no evidence that orcas grieve as we do. Zoologist and author Jules Howard wrote:
>Pedantic (and blunt) as it sounds, if you believe J35 was displaying evidence of mourning or grief, you are making a case that rests on faith not on scientific endeavour, and that makes me uncomfortable as a scientist.[^fn11]

But researchers who study animal behavior strongly challenged that view. As Barbara King, a biological anthropologist who has studied animal grief for years put it:

>"I am as sure as I can be in a scientific framework that there's an expression here of her sorrow. We know by now that animal joy, animal sorrow, animal fear, animal happiness, animal grief, the whole gamut exists. So these emotions don't (just) belong to humans."[^fn3]

Mark Bekoff, a behavioral ecologist, put it even more directly:

> There is no doubt that many animals experience rich and deep emotions. It's not a matter of if emotions have evolved in animals but why they have evolved as they have. We must never forget that our emotions are the gifts of our ancestors, our animal kin. We have feelings and so do other animals.[^fn1]

These conflicting interpretations reveal something deeper than disagreement about animal behavior—they expose fundamental differences in how we think about consciousness and how it has evolved on Earth. The facts—Tahlequah's seventeen-day vigil, her physical exhaustion, her pod's accompanying presence—are not in dispute. But how we interpret those facts, what we think they mean, reflects one of the most consequential questions we face: Is rich and complex consciousness a unique evolutionary accident in *Homo sapiens*, or might other species have evolved consciousness similarly rich, even if utterly alien to us?

The presumption of human superiority runs deep in Western thought, shaping how decision-makers in industrialized society relate to the natural world. This presumption appears in both dominant narratives of our time: traditional theism, which places humans at the apex of divine creation, and the modern secular view, which treats consciousness as an accidental byproduct of recent evolutionary history. Though grounded in opposing metaphysics, both converge on the same assumption: that human consciousness—particularly our capacities for abstraction and technology—represents the pinnacle of what consciousness can be.

But what if this assumption is wrong? What if mind[^fn2] is not an accident but a fundamental aspect of nature itself? What if Earth has been home, for millions of years, to species whose consciousness is as rich as ours but organized according to completely different principles? And what if we're destroying these beings without ever recognizing what we're losing?

## An Anomaly That Demands Attention

Tahlequah is an orca, one of approximately 75 species of odontocetes—toothed whales that include dolphins, porpoises, and sperm whales. These beings have thrived in Earth's oceans for tens of millions of years. Tahlequah's brain weighs about five kilograms, more than three times the mass of a typical human brain. Her ancestors possessed brains of similar size five million years ago, when our earliest proto-human ancestors were just beginning to walk upright in Africa.

This is not a minor curiosity. Multiple species of odontocetes evolved and maintained these massive, metabolically expensive brains along independent lineages and across geological time—representing what may be earth's longest-running experiment in complex neural architecture. Sperm whales have sustained brains weighing up to nine kilograms—six times larger than ours—for fifteen million years. Pilot whales possess more than 37 billion neurons, more than twice the human count. The human brain consumes roughly twenty percent of our metabolic energy despite representing only two percent of our body weight—an enormous biological commitment. These cetacean species made and have maintained similar investments, not for thousands of years but for millions.

Why? If consciousness is merely an accidental byproduct of neural complexity, as the standard materialist story suggests, why would evolution repeatedly invest in and sustain such metabolically-intensive brain tissue? What purpose does all that neural architecture serve?

Behavioral evidence compounds the puzzle. Dolphins comprehend abstract concepts like "same" and "different." They recognize themselves in mirrors—a capacity once thought unique to humans, great apes, and elephants--and can report their own uncertainty during cognitive tasks, forms of metacognition that suggests genuine self-awareness. They understand both symbolic gestures and grammatical structure in ways that challenge our definitions of language. Odontocetes maintain distinct cultures and transmit cultural values through generations. And they demonstrate social bonding and networking rivaling that of humans.

Researchers in a 30-year study in coastal Australia have documented alliance networks among bottlenose dolphins that span hundreds of individuals across decades. These are not simple cooperative relationships but sophisticated, multi-tiered coalitions requiring individuals to track not just their own allies, but their allies' allies, navigating political landscapes that shift over years. Orcas maintain distinct cultural traditions—different hunting techniques, vocal dialects, and social practices—that are transmitted across generations and never shared even with neighboring populations whose territories overlap. Sperm whales, with their enormous brains, produce complex patterns of clicks—codas—that function as cultural markers, with different clans maintaining different repertoires across ocean basins.


Sound is the primary sense of odontocetes and the means by which they navigate, communicate, and perceive their world. They process overlapping acoustic information from multiple sources—not just echoes reflected from objects but also, research indicates, internal conditions revealed through frequencies similar to ultrasound technology. The entirety of their communications is constantly available to everyone within acoustic range. There can be no secrets between dolphins.

What might consciousness be like in such a radically different sensory world? Neurobiologist Harry Jerison, whose pioneering work on brain evolution we'll explore in detail later, proposed that highly encephalized[^fn4] brains don't merely process information—they actively construct species-specific realities. Contemporary neuroscience supports this insight through predictive processing and perceptual inference: brains continuously build and update internal models of the world, creating the reality we experience. This applies to all animals, but the experienced worlds of large-brained species are far more complex due to their vastly greater information-processing capacities. And when species with such capacities also occupy fundamentally different sensory environments—acoustic three-dimensional ocean vs. visual terrestrial landscape—the resulting experiences may be profoundly alien to each other.

For odontocetes navigating a three-dimensional, acoustic environment, this reality-construction produces fundamentally different forms of conscious experience. Their cognitive architecture appears oriented toward what might be called a purely experiential mode of being—immersed in immediate, relational awareness through sound rather than the abstract, symbolic thinking that dominates human consciousness. While we cannot know the subjective nature of their experience, their brains suggest lives lived in a continuous acoustic present, processing simultaneous streams of social, environmental, and internal information in ways that may have no human parallel.
Although our knowledge of cetacean biology and behavior remains limited, we know that odontocetes create and maintain cultures. They recognize themselves as individuals. They navigate social landscapes of remarkable complexity. They communicate in ways we are only beginning to understand. And they have been doing all of this for far longer than humans have existed.

The evidence doesn't prove what we might call cosmic equivalence--the possibility that these beings are our cognitive or experiential peers. But it creates a genuine puzzle that the standard materialist story struggles to explain. Odontocete lineages achieved neural complexity millions of years before we appeared. They have maintained  their cognitive and experiential capacities across timescales that dwarf human history. They evolved sustainable cultures that have persisted for geological ages--while our own technological civilization, barely a few thousand years old, threatens its own continuation. Perhaps we should ask what we might learn from beings who have maintained complex, stable societies for millions of years.

The question is urgent because these lineages are disappearing. Ocean acidification, industrial fishing, chemical pollution, underwater noise that disrupts their communication and navigation, climate change—all are systematically destroying marine ecosystems that have sustained complex cetacean consciousness for tens of millions of years. We may have only decades to study forms of awareness that took geological ages to evolve.

If consciousness is merely an evolutionary accident—if the materialist story is complete—then cetacean extinction is tragic but not cosmically significant. But if the evidence pointing toward an equivalence of interiority is valid—if these beings represent alternative experiments in consciousness potentially as rich as our own—then we may be committing one of the great moral catastrophes of history while our inherited framework prevents us from seeing what we're doing. We may be destroying peers, perhaps even teachers whose long existence offers lessons about sustainable intelligence, without recognizing them.

Everything depends on our worldview, or the story we live within.

## Living As If: Choosing a Worldview

We cannot prove that Tahlequah was genuinely grieving. We have no direct access to her subjective experience. We cannot prove that consciousness is fundamental rather than emergent, that cetaceans are our cognitive or experiential equals, or that mind is woven into the fabric of reality rather than being a late-arriving accident of evolution. We cannot prove any of these things with the kind of certainty we might wish for.

And yet, for seventeen days, millions of people responded to Tahlequah as if her grief were real, as if her consciousness mattered as much as ours, as if the connection we felt across species boundaries revealed something true about the nature of reality. We lived, briefly, within a different framework—one that recognized consciousness in another form, that acknowledged kinship beyond our species, that treated experience as real and significant regardless of whether it could be mathematically measured or scientifically proven.

What if we lived that way all the time? What if when we looked at an orca or a dolphin we saw not just a remarkable marine mammal but a being with a fundamentally different but potentially no less rich sense of experience? Would it change how we relate to the natural world, and perhaps to each other?

This book is built on a simple but consequential claim: in the absence of metaphysical certainty about the nature of consciousness and reality, we must choose a framework to live within. The question is not only "Is it true?" but "What happens if we live as if it were true?" All worldviews, including the one that dominates contemporary thought, are maps of reality—not reality itself. They are useful fictions, ways of organizing experience and guiding action. The question is not which map is absolutely true, but which map or framework serves us better.

This is not relativism; not all frameworks are equally good. Some lead to flourishing, connection, and sustainable ways of being. Others lead to destruction, alienation, and existential crisis. We can evaluate worldviews by their consequences—psychological, ethical, existential, practical. We can ask: What kind of world does this framework create? What possibilities does it make visible or invisible? What does it mean for how we treat other beings, ourselves, and the living systems that sustain us?

The modern scientific worldview has given us unprecedented power over the physical world—medicine, technology, the ability to predict and manipulate natural processes with remarkable precision. These are genuine achievements that any credible alternative must acknowledge and preserve. But this same worldview has also contributed to a crisis of meaning, a pervasive sense of alienation from nature and from each other, and a trajectory that appears to be leading toward ecological catastrophe.

What if we're working within a framework that makes some crucial things invisible? What if consciousness is not an anomaly to be explained away but a fundamental dimension of reality that our current map systematically excludes? What if the possibility of cosmic equivalence—that we share this planet with beings who are our cognitive peers—is real, but our framework prevents us from recognizing it?

This book invites you to experiment with living as if consciousness were fundamental rather than derivative—not as an article of faith, but as a working hypothesis whose consequences we can observe and evaluate.

## What Lies Ahead

This exploration unfolds in four parts, each examining our central questions from different angles. The structure is intentionally holographic—key themes will spiral and return, each time revealing new facets and connections.

Part I examines how we got here—how the participatory cosmos of our ancestors gave way to the mechanical universe of modern science, and why this transformation, however productive, may have been incomplete. We'll trace the historical arc from a world alive with meaning and purpose to one that treats consciousness as an embarrassing accident, and we'll see why the modern scientific worldview, despite its genuine achievements, struggles to accommodate the very minds that constructed it.

Part II presents evidence that doesn't fit comfortably within the inherited framework. We'll examine cetacean neuroscience and behavior in detail, exploring what their massive, ancient brains and sophisticated social lives might reveal about the nature of consciousness. We'll also look at quantum mechanics and mind-body phenomena—domains where the purely physical description seems incomplete, where consciousness appears to play a role that mechanistic models cannot easily explain.

Part III develops the philosophical alternative. Drawing on thinkers from William James to Alfred North Whitehead to contemporary philosophers of consciousness, we'll construct a framework that treats consciousness as fundamental rather than derivative, that sees reality as both physical and experiential, that makes room for meaning and purpose without requiring supernatural intervention.

Part IV explores what it means to live within this framework. What are the ethical implications if cetaceans might be our equals? What changes existentially when consciousness becomes fundamental rather than accidental? How do we navigate life holding our metaphysical commitments lightly while still allowing them to guide us? This is about practice, about bringing philosophy down from abstraction into the texture of daily life.

Throughout, certain themes will spiral and return: the possibility of cosmic equivalence between humans and cetaceans, the contrast between experiential and abstractive modes of being, the meaning crisis afflicting modern culture, and the vision of a participatory cosmos in which we belong rather than merely exist. These themes will deepen and connect as we progress, each examination revealing new facets of the central question.

## Notes on Certainty and Consequence

These ideas may prove wrong. What's offered here is a framework, not truth—consciousness as fundamental, cetaceans as our cosmic peers, the universe as participatory rather than mechanistic. One possible map of a territory we all inhabit but none of us fully understand.

But the modern scientific worldview is also a choice, not a proven truth. It too is a map, not the territory. It is one interpretive framework among others, and despite its genuine achievements and undeniable utility in certain domains, it may be incomplete in ways that matter profoundly—psychologically, ethically, existentially, and practically.

The alternative proposed here deserves serious consideration—not because it's certainly true, but because the consequences of living within it might be significantly better. Better for our relationship with the natural world. Better for the possibility of recognizing and preserving forms of consciousness that took millions of years to evolve. Better for addressing the crisis of meaning that haunts modern culture despite our material prosperity. Better for creating a future in which technological power is guided by wisdom rather than leading to self-destruction.

If we're destroying beings who are our cognitive equals—if the possibility of cosmic equivalence is real—then we are committing one of the great moral catastrophes of history, and doing so blindly, prevented from seeing what we're doing by the very framework we've inherited for making sense of the world. This is not an academic issue. It's urgent; it's highly consequential; and it demands a response.

## The Invitation

Tahlequah still swims in those waters. Her species faces existential threats from changes we have made to her world. The evidence—both the cetacean findings and the meaning crisis we ourselves experience—demands a response.

For seventeen days in the summer of 2018, we lived as if her grief were real, as if her consciousness mattered as much as ours, as if the connection we felt across species boundaries revealed something true about the nature of existence. What if we never stopped living that way? What if we allowed that recognition to reshape how we understand consciousness, how we relate to the natural world, how we interpret our place in the cosmos?

This book asks you to consider that possibility. Not as dogma to be believed, but as an experiment to be lived. Not as a rejection of science, but as an expansion of what we consider natural. Not as a return to pre-modern superstition, but as a move forward to a more complete understanding that integrates scientific rigor with the dimensions of meaning and consciousness that the modern scientific worldview has systematically excluded.

The choice is yours. The universe may be watching through our eyes to see what we decide.
