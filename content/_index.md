In Edwin Abbott’s 1884 satirical novel *Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions*, the inhabitants of a two-dimensional world struggle—and mostly fail—to conceive of dimensions beyond their own. Isaac Asimov once praised *Flatland* as “probably the best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions,” warning us to be cautious about the boundaries we unconsciously impose on our understanding of reality.{{< sidenote >}}Isaac Asimov, "Limitations," Introduction to *Flatland*, Barnes & Noble edition, 1983{{< /sidenote >}}

Our current conceptual framework may be similarly constrained. For centuries, the dominant cosmological model in Western thought has portrayed the universe as a vast mechanism: a grand array of discrete objects moving through space and time under fixed, mind-independent laws. Humans, according to this model, are merely observers—complex biological machines whose fleeting awareness arises from electrochemical events within the brain.

This classical conception,{{< sidenote >}}see ["classical worldview"]({{< relref "articles/classical_worldview/index.md" >}}) in this project for a brief summary of just that.{{< /sidenote >}} rooted in Aristotelian thought, codified by Newtonian physics, and reinforced by Darwinian biology’s naturalistic account of life’s development, remains the framework of modern Western civilization. It has shaped not only our science, but also our philosophy, law, and even religion. In this view, often referred to as physicalism, reality is singular, objective, and composed entirely of measurable, material stuff.{{< sidenote >}}see ["physicalism"]({{< relref "articles/physicalism/index.md" >}})

Over the last century or so, the physicalist framework has solidified its hold on Western secular thought and has morphed into the belief that science is the only valid means of describing reality.{{< sidenote >}}often referred to as scientism.

It is perhaps an understandable belief, as modern science and technology have inarguably enabled an unprecedented level of health and prosperity for most humans. But what if the scientistic framework, powerful as it has been, is as limited as the worldview of Abbott’s Flatlanders? What if mind, spirit, or some other form of intrinsic subjectivity is not an accidental byproduct of physical complexity, but a fundamental dimension of existence?

This project begins from the premise that we are poised at the threshold of a conceptual revolution—one that may ultimately prove as if not more disruptive and transformative than the Copernican and Cartesian shifts that reoriented a millennia-long blending of Aristotelian and Christian cosmologies and ushered in the modern scientific age. The core of this revolution is the premise that non-material phenomena are not exclusively derivative of physical processes but instead derive in substantive part from a realm of reality largely inaccessible to scientific investigation. is not a derivative phenomenon to be explained away, but a primary reality in its own right.

By simply being willing to consider the belief that reality is not exclusively physical—and that is indeed a belief, not an evidence-based conclusion— an immense horizon immediately opens for exploration. It is a horizon that has been long proclaimed by esoteric philosophies and contemplative traditions, and a growing body of evidence from physics, biology, philosophy, and suggests that it is indeed real. 


{{<newthought>}} The first significant fractures {{< /newthought>}} in the classical worldview appeared with the advent of quantum mechanics (QM) a century ago. Quantum theory, experimentally confirmed without exception across thousands of tests, reveals a cosmos very different from the orderly machine envisioned by Newton and his successors. At the quantum level, matter behaves like neither discrete particles nor continuous waves, but in strange hybrids that defy classical categorization. Entities become entangled across vast distances, influencing one another instantaneously. The act of measurement seems to play an active role in shaping what is observed.

These discoveries challenge the notion that reality is fully separable from the act of observation. They raise profound questions about the nature of consciousness and the relationship between the observer and the observed. Wolfgang Pauli, one of the founding architects of QM, understood that quantum theory demanded a “new idea of reality”—one that could accommodate the inextricable link between subjective awareness and the fabric of existence itself.

Yet despite its revolutionary implications, quantum theory has been treated by most scientists as just a set of useful mathematical tools, not as a foundation for rethinking reality. As Niels Bohr insisted, quantum phenomena simply “are what they are,” requiring no deeper philosophical reckoning. For most practical purposes in science and technology, the classical view persists: nature is real, objective, and fully comprehensible through measurement, mathematics, and theory.

But for a growing number of thinkers, this is no longer tenable. As David Finkelstein put it, “The deeper you go into quantum mechanics, the harder it is to hold on to any absolutes.”{{< sidenote >}}citation for Finklestein’s quote{{< /sidenote >}}
 The universe revealed by quantum mechanics is profoundly relational, participatory, and indeterminate at its core.

{{<newthought>}} A central commitment of this project {{< /newthought>}} is that whatever a deeper understanding of reality entails, it must remain fully natural—grounded in nature as a whole, without recourse to supernatural interventions.

However, “natural” must be reimagined. It cannot remain restricted to what is merely physical, measurable, or material in the classical sense. Consciousness, meaning, value, and experience—these too are natural phenomena, even if they elude reduction to physical substrates.

The prevailing worldview of scientism—the belief that science alone, narrowly defined, is the sole path to truth—rests on a crucial and often unexamined assumption: that everything real is ultimately physical. But this is not a scientific discovery; it is a philosophical presumption. Science, by its own methods, cannot adjudicate the ultimate nature of being—it can only explore patterns within experience.

Thomas Nagel, among others, has argued for an alternative framework, a *tertium quid* or “third way” beyond the false dichotomy of reductive materialism and supernatural theism. A worldview that acknowledges mind and meaning as fundamental aspects of the natural order, alongside but not reducible to physical law. This project explores some of the contours of such a framework: a natural spirituality that recognizes the profound interconnectedness of all that is, without abandoning scientific rigor or descending into dogmatic metaphysics.

A significant implication of this broader perspective is a reframing of our assumptions about intelligence, consciousness, and the human place in the cosmos. Western thought has long imagined Homo sapiens as the pinnacle of evolution, the sole bearers of complex abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and technological mastery. Intelligence, by this account, is measured by the ability to manipulate matter and generate increasingly sophisticated models of the physical world.

But this view is increasingly difficult to sustain. Odontocetes—dolphins, orcas, sperm whales, and other toothed whales—exhibit evidence of advanced consciousness and have maintained relative morphological stasis for millions of years,{{< sidenote >}}Dolphins, sperm whales, orcas and many of the dozens of Odontocete species have brains that are larger and similarly complex as humans, but they have had no substantive changes in their brain or body size. By outward appearances, they have changed very little since the first hominids evolved from monkeys some 20 million years ago. We simply do not know, but it does not seem unreasonable to speculate, that during during those millions of years they used their large and biologically expensive brains to achieve communication on levels that we can barely imagine. {{< /sidenote >}} 
 Their brains are comparable in size and complexity to ours; their social structures, cultural transmission, and communication systems suggest forms of intelligence that are at least as rich, if differently expressed.

If the universe is saturated with mind-like properties, as panpsychism and related frameworks suggest, then intelligence need not take a single archetypal form. Complex abstraction and tool-use may be one expression of higher intelligence, but they are not necessarily its apex. Emotional depth, social cohesion, symbolic richness, aesthetic experience—these too may be markers of highly evolved consciousness.
The recognition that humans are not alone among intelligent species compels a humbler, more expansive view of consciousness: not as a late, accidental bloom on an otherwise dead tree of matter, but as a pervasive and diverse phenomenon woven through the fabric of reality itself.


{{<newthought>}} In contemporary philosophy of mind, {{< /newthought>}}  much effort is spent attempting to define consciousness precisely—to specify its boundaries, mechanisms, and evolutionary function. These efforts, while valuable, often founder on the ambiguity and familiarity of the phenomenon itself. The 1989 *International Dictionary of Psychology* stated that “Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written about it.” {{< sidenote >}}Sutherland 1989){{< /sidenote >}}

Although a veritable industry of consciousness studies has sprung up since then, not much has changed from it all. As David Chalmers and others have observed, consciousness remains elusive not because we fail to observe it, but because it is our primary mode of existence. Much like water to a fish, consciousness is something we are fully immersed in.  It is, as Galen Strawson suggests, the only thing whose intrinsic nature we can claim to know directly.

This project proposes that it is far less important to define consciousness than to learn how to use it more fully, deliberately, and effectively. Just as electricity revolutionized human life long before its essential nature was understood (and that continues to have multiple, contradictory meanings or definitions), so too consciousness holds transformative potential even in the absence of theoretical clarity.

Rather than seeking final definitions, to what is likely an indefinable phenomena, we might better turn our efforts toward developing more skillful relationships with consciousness: cultivating attention, meaning, coherence, and creative power. Understanding how subjective phenomena shape the world—and how they might be directed toward deeper insight, connection, and flourishing.


{{<newthought>}} The ideas explored here  {{< /newthought>}} draw on multiple but what appear to be ultimately related streams of thought. Various esoteric and contemplative traditions have long envisioned a central order of the cosmos—an intrinsic harmony beyond mechanism. Monism in its various forms (some ancient) holds that everything ultimately consists of the same fundamental stuff, although there is considerable disagreement about the nature of that stuff. The dominant forms of monism in Western thought include: idealism (the idea that reality is fundamental mental or spiritual); philosophical materialism (also known as physicalism, the idea that reality is fundamentally physical); and various forms of neutral monism (that the single underlying stuff is neither mental nor physical but neutral or a mixture of both). In Hindu philosophy, Advaita Vedānta teaches that everything is Brahman (pure consciousness or existence itself). Panpsychist perspectives, also with deep historical roots, see mind-like qualities as fundamental to all things. 

More recently, the discoveries of quantum physics led to David Bohm’s framework of deep connection between an underlying order beyond space and time (the implicate order) that unfolds into the observable world (the explicate order), and the idea of a psychophysical continuum of entangled inner and outer realities developed in a decades-long collaboration between Wolfgang Pauli and Carl Jung. 

Taken alone, none of these streams offers a complete framework or worldview. But woven together, they suggest the outlines of a mind-centered cosmology: a framework in which consciousness is not an incidental phenomenon, but a core dimension of the unfolding universe. It is an unfinished and evolving picture—provisional and incomplete—and exploring it demands humility.  It is largely intuitive; our language (and thus the way we think about things) strains or is simply unable to express much about it. Just as the citizens of Flatland who didn’t outright reject the idea of a third dimension struggled to imagine it, many if not most of us are hindered by our preconceived ideas and an expectation of certain truth. 
  
Yet if we resist the temptation to cling to outdated certainties and instead open ourselves to the possibility of a vastly richer natural order, we may begin to glimpse a new horizon: a world in which mind and matter are no longer alien to one another, but aspects of a single, dynamic whole. We are at the very beginning of what may one day be recognized as a new age of consciousness. If this is so, it will not replace science, logic, or empirical inquiry, but rather expand the scope of what we understand to be real.

Certainties will remain elusive, but our models can be refined, our myths can evolve, and our conceptual lenses can widen. The task, as Wolfgang Pauli and others have urged, is not to abandon reason, but to construct a broader and deeper idea of reality—one that acknowledges mind as fundamental, honors experience as meaningful, and restores a sense of belonging within the vast and mysterious unfolding of existence.

My hope is that this project makes a small contribution to that ongoing task: a search for frameworks that better fit what we know, what we sense, and what we are only beginning to imagine.
