intro: |
  For millions of years, cetaceans have evolved sophisticated minds organized around principles entirely different from our own. Their existence challenges our most basic assumptions about consciousness, intelligence, and what it means to be a thinking being in this universe.

about: |
  This book offers a framework—not a metaphysical truth claim—for understanding consciousness as fundamental rather than derivative. Using cetacean cognition as primary evidence and drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, and physics, it presents an alternative to both the modern scientific worldview and traditional theism.
  
  The framework is offered pragmatically: judge it by its consequences, not by claims of metaphysical certainty. The question is not only "Is it true?" but "What happens if we live as if it were true?"
