One of the most fascinating debates in scientific history was the
ongoing disagreement between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr about
reality and quantum theory, particularly between “realists” and those
who accepted the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) proposed by Bohr.

other metaphysical models of quantum mechanics.{{< /sidenote >}} 
Einstein was an unwavering realist. He believed reality was fundamentally knowable if we had enough information. “God does not play dice with the universe,” one of
Einstein’s famous quotes, sums up his refusal to believe that
probability was the fundamental basis for physical reality.

Einstein’s refusal to believe in the fundamental nature of probability
led him to conclude that quantum theory was incomplete and that the
wave function was not the final word on a particle's behavior.
It was, instead, the result of insufficient understanding of
the quantum world. Once we knew more about the nature of the quantum world,
we would be able to describe a particle in more than probabilistic
terms.

Bohr argued that the wave function was the most complete description possible, and that trying to dig deeper into ‘hidden realities’ was meaningless within quantum mechanics.
 One of the specific issues around which this debate
raged was the question of what happens to a pair of particles created
together– for example, a pair of photons created simultaneously. Quantum
theory requires that these photons have complementary characteristics,
but it also requires that those characteristics cannot be known until
they are measured.

The difficulty for Einstein (and other realists) comes from how those
photons are connected. According to the CI, the photon pair
characteristics exist only as a wave function (any characteristic
can be anywhere within the range of all possible characteristics). But,
and this is hugely important, both photons must have corresponding
characteristics, whatever they turn out to be. Using a simplified example, let’s say that the photons have a
characteristic of 'up/down.' When a photon pair is created, both photons
exist as a wave function that can be either 'up' or 'down,' but
whatever it turns out to be will be the same for both photons. However,
we can’t know if they are 'up' or 'down' until we measure one of them.
At that point the wave function collapses, and the photon is revealed to be “up”. Quantum theory says that we now
know that the other photon is also “up”. But if both photons existed as
equal probabilities of being 'up' or 'down' until one of them is
measured, how does the second photon know that it is 'up,' as required
by quantum theory. The first photon could have just as easily been
measured 'down,' in which the second photon would also be 'down.' Of course, photons don’t ‘know’ in any conscious sense, but this is the puzzle the mathematics presents. To put it another way, it’s as if you flipped two coins on opposite sides of the universe, and every time one lands heads, the other does too—instantly.

This connection between the photons is called “entanglement” in quantum
theory, and was referred to by Einstein as “spooky action at a
distance”. Because nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, it
is impossible for the photons (moving away from each other at the speed
of light) to communicate with each other about the state of “up/down”.
Einstein maintained that there were “hidden variables” within each
photon that determined the state of the photon pair. The fact that we
don’t know about those variables doesn’t mean that they aren’t there;
and how else could the photons know about their mutual state? Einstein
remained firmly in the realist camp, joined by many high-caliber colleagues.

The physics is clear—we observe entanglement in experiments. What remains unsettled is how to interpret what the mathematics and experiments really mean about the nature of reality. Entanglement is at the heart of cutting-edge technologies, including quantum computing and cryptography.  It also shows how ideas that once seemed remote and abstract lie at the very core of how we understand the world--and our place in it.
