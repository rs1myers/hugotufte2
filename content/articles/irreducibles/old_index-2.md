## What If Consciousness Simply Is?

Every explanation has to stop somewhere. When physicists tell us that electrons have charge, or that the speed of light is constant, or that quantum fields exist, we can ask: Why? Why do electrons have the charge they do rather than some other value? Why does the universe obey these particular laws rather than different ones?

The honest answer is: we don't know. More importantly, many physicists argue we may never know---because some facts about reality simply don't have deeper explanations. They're what philosophers call "brute facts" or "irreducible properties": features of the universe that are fundamental, that bottom out, that just are.

This idea isn't controversial in physics. As philosopher Eliot Sober notes in his review of Thomas Nagel's work, "Scientists already leave room for brute facts... When they say that a law is 'fundamental,' they mean that it can't be explained by anything deeper." {{< sidenote >}} Elliot Sober, ["Remarkable Facts,"](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/remarkable-facts/Boston) 50 Review, November 7, 2012 {{< /sidenote >}} Physicist Sean Carroll puts it even more directly: “At the deepest level, the laws of physics might just be brute facts. Asking for something deeper could simply be a confusion.” {{< sidenote >}}Sean Carroll, *The Big Picture*, p. 355){{< /sidenote >}}

But notice the assumption here: that irreducible features such as charge, mass and quantum fields are purely physical in nature. What if that assumption is itself the problem? What if the fundamental features of reality can't be neatly categorized as either purely mental or purely physical?

Philosophers call this position 'neutral monism'—the view that reality is fundamentally neither mental nor physical, but something more basic that manifests as both. The mental and physical aren't separate substances that interact, but different aspects or poles of a single underlying reality.

This isn't a new idea. William James explored it. Bertrand Russell defended it. But perhaps the most intriguing version comes from an unlikely, decades-long collaboration between physicist Wolfgang Pauli and psychologist Carl Jung. They proposed what they called the 'psychophysical continuum'—a spectrum with pure psyche (archetypal, subjective, meaning-laden) at one pole and pure physical (objective, measurable, causal) at the other. Everything in reality, they suggested, exists somewhere along this continuum, participating in both aspects to varying degrees.

From this perspective, the traditional mind-body problem dissolves rather than gets solved. We're not asking 'how does matter produce mind?' or 'how does mind produce matter?' We're recognizing that both are aspects of something more fundamental---something that is irreducible precisely because it's prior to the mental/physical distinction itself.

This is not at all to say that consciousness "emerges" from anything---not from matter, not from proto-experiences, not from quantum processes.

Emergence language suggests that something genuinely new appears from the combination of simpler elements—that 2+2 somehow equals 5. But emergence in this strong sense is just a label for mystery, not an explanation. Saying "consciousness emerges from neural complexity" is just saying "somehow, when brains get complex enough, consciousness appears"---which explains nothing.

As we'll explore shortly, consciousness might be irreducible and fundamental---present "all the way down," not emerging at some special threshold. The question isn't "at what point does consciousness emerge?" but rather "what is the relationship between fundamental consciousness and physical organization?"

This is closer to how electromagnetic phenomena relate to charged particles. The electromagnetic field doesn't "emerge" from charges---it's fundamental. What varies is how it manifests depending on configuration and complexity.


**The Collapse of Explanatory Asymmetry**

For decades, reductive materialism claimed a powerful advantage: it explained more. The physical explained the mental, not the other way around. Physics was fundamental; everything else was derivative. This wasn't just a scientific claim---it was an argument about which worldview was intellectually superior.

But the moment we accept that physical properties themselves are irreducible---that charge, mass, fields, and fundamental laws simply exist without deeper explanation---this supposed advantage becomes moot. Consider what philosopher Galen Strawson calls "physically-inflationary metaphysics":{{< sidenote >}}Strawson, G. (2008). "Real naturalism," in *Real materialism and other essays* (pp. 53–74). Oxford University Press.{{< /sidenote >}} the assumption that we know what "the physical" is, and that we know it can't include anything experiential. But physics actually tells us nothing about the intrinsic nature of matter. As Bertrand Russell argued nearly a century ago 

> Physics is purely structural; it tells us nothing of the intrinsic character of physical events. If anything is known about intrinsic character, it is known through experience. Thus, the mental is the only example we have of intrinsic character; mind and matter cannot be categorically opposed.{{< sidenote >}}Bertrand Russell, *The Analysis of Matter*, 1927{{< /sidenote >}}

Whatever that intrinsic nature is, Russell concluded, it must be primitive and irreducible. Physics simply does not (and cannot) tell us whether that intrinsic nature includes, allows for, or relates to consciousness. Almost a century later, Strawson argues for the irreducibility of consciousness:

> It’s ironic that the people who are most likely to doubt or deny the existence of consciousness (on the ground that everything is physical, and that consciousness can’t possibly be physical) are also those who are most insistent on the primacy of science, because it is precisely science that makes the key point shine most brightly: the point that there is a fundamental respect in which ultimate intrinsic nature of the stuff of the universe is unknown to us — except insofar as it is consciousness.{{< sidenote >}}Galen Strawson, "Consciousness Isn't a Mystery, It's matter," New York Times opinion, May 16, 2016{{< /sidenote >}}

If one accepts this perspective, the landscape transforms. Both worldviews—reductive materialism and fundamental mind—rest on the same foundation: unexplained primitives. Neither explains "all the way down." Both make a choice about what to place at the bottom of their explanatory hierarchy.
Physicalism says: Matter is fundamental and unexplained. Mind somehow emerges from it (also unexplained at the deepest level).

A consciousness-inclusive view says: Mind (or proto-experiential properties) is fundamental and unexplained. Physical structure and behavior somehow relate to it (also unexplained at the deepest level).To be clear: treating consciousness as fundamental need not mean that electrons have tiny experiences that somehow combine into higher levels of consciousness---the combination problem that p lagues some versions of panpsychism. It might mean something akin to consciousness as a fundamental aspect or dimension of reality, manifesting differently through different physical organizations—more like a field than a particle property, more verb than noun.

The structures are identical. They differ only in what they choose as primitive.

**Why This Changes Everything**

This isn't just a philosophical technicality. It fundamentally reshapes the debate about consciousness in three crucial ways:

First, it removes the supposed scientific high ground of reductive materialism. The claim that "consciousness must reduce to physical processes" isn't a scientific conclusion---it's a metaphysical preference for certain kinds of primitives over others. Science itself, as Sober notes, should remain "open to the possibility that some causal relationships are brute facts," including those involving consciousness.

Second, it reveals the mind-body problem as potentially misconceived. If consciousness is a fundamental, irreducible property of reality---as basic as charge or mass---then asking "how does matter produce consciousness?" is like asking "how does the universe produce charge?" The question assumes something needs explaining that might simply be. 

If consciousness is fundamental---not a property particles have but an aspect of reality itself---then the mind-body problem transforms. The question becomes not 'how does non-conscious matter produce consciousness?' but 'how does fundamental consciousness manifest through different physical configurations?' This is still challenging, but it's a different kind of challenge---one about structure and organization rather than about something emerging from its absolute opposite.

Third, it transforms the question from "which view is true?" to "which primitives make more sense given everything we know?" And here the balance shifts. Physical properties like charge and mass don't predict or necessitate consciousness---there's nothing about the mathematics of quantum field theory that suggests "and this will produce subjective experience." But if consciousness (or proto-experiential properties) is fundamental, then the rich inner life of complex organisms becomes expected rather than miraculous, natural rather than inexplicable.

**The Corroborating Evidence**

This isn't idle speculation. Thomas Nagel, in Mind and Cosmos, argues extensively that reductive approaches to consciousness systematically fail---not because we lack detailed knowledge, but because the explanatory strategy itself is inadequate:

>It may be frustrating to acknowledge, but we are simply at the point in the history of human thought at which we find ourselves, and our successors will make discoveries and develop forms of understanding of which we have not even dreamt.  Humans are addicted to the hope for a final reckoning, but intellectual humility requires that we resist the temptation to assume that the tools of the kind we now have are in principle sufficient to understand the universe as a whole.” {{< sidenote >}}Nagel, Thomas. Mind and Cosmos (p. 12). Oxford University Press. Kindle Edition.{{< /sidenote >}}

The felt quality of experience, the unity of consciousness, the directedness of intentionality---these resist reduction not because of our ignorance but because of their nature.

You don't have to accept Nagel's controversial teleological conclusions to recognize the force of his critique: the reductive program hasn't just stalled, it has encountered what appear to be principled barriers. After decades of neuroscience and cognitive science, we can map correlations between brain states and conscious experiences in exquisite detail. What we still cannot do---what many philosophers now argue we cannot in principle do---is explain why any physical process should feel like something at all.

The persistent explanatory gap isn't a temporary problem awaiting the next breakthrough. It may be telling us something important: that we're asking the wrong kind of question, applying reductive strategies where irreducibility is the actual nature of things.

**From Metaphysics to Consequences**

So where does this leave us? Not with proof that consciousness is fundamental---such proof may be impossible in principle. Not with certainty that reductive materialism is false---it remains a coherent metaphysical position. But with something equally important: recognition that both frameworks are metaphysically legitimate choices resting on comparable foundations.

Neither worldview can claim epistemic superiority based on "explaining more" or "assuming less" or being "more scientific." Both bottom out in primitives. Both require metaphysical commitments beyond what science alone can establish. Both are metaphysical commitments, different in type but not in kind, and both are informed by evidence, coherence, and consequences.

There are, of course, various ways to think about consciousness as fundamental---from different forms of panpsychism to neutral monism to idealism. I'm not arguing for any specific metaphysics here, only that none can be ruled out by appeals to scientific superiority or explanatory parsimony. The evaluation requires different criteria.

As equally legitimate metaphysical frameworks, a question arises: What follows from living as if each were true? What does each worldview generate in terms of meaning, ethics, value, and action? What kind of world does each create when taken seriously? When metaphysical proof is impossible but practical consequences are undeniable, the question transforms. We can't settle the metaphysics conclusively, but we can evaluate the sorts of things that each framework leads to when actually lived.

This is the shift from metaphysical argument to pragmatic assessment---from asking "which is certainly true?" to asking "which framework better serves truth, meaning, and flourishing when we actually live it out?"

The modern scientific worldview, taken to its logical conclusions, suggests that consciousness is an accidental byproduct, that meaning is illusion, that purpose is projection. It has given us tremendous technological power while leaving us, as many now recognize, in a meaning crisis---able to manipulate matter but unable to say why anything matters.

A consciousness-inclusive worldview suggests something different: that mind isn't a cosmic accident but a fundamental feature, that the rich experiential lives of humans and other conscious beings aren't aberrations but expressions of something basic to reality itself. And if that's the case---if we're living as if consciousness is fundamental---then the consequences ripple outward in profound ways, particularly for how we treat other minds.

This is where our inquiry leads: not to certainty about ultimate metaphysics, but to recognition that we face a choice---and that choosing has consequences we can evaluate, test, and live by.
