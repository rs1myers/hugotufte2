scientific description of the world that began with Greek philosophers
and reached its zenith in the 19th century. It was conceived 2,500 years
ago as a rational replacement of myths about gods who controlled the
world by imposing their whims through acts of nature they caused. As
Morris Kline put it:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Greek intellectuals adopted a totally new attitude toward
nature. This attitude was rational, critical, and secular. Mythology
was discarded as was the belief that the gods manipulate man and the
physical world according to their whims. The intellectuals
eventually arrived at the doctrine that nature is orderly and
functions invariably according to a grand design. All phenomena
apparent to the senses, from the motion of the planets to the
stirrings of the leaves on a tree, can be fitted into a precise,
coherent, intelligible pattern. In short, nature is rationally
designed and that design, though unaffected by human actions, can be
apprehended by man&rsquo;s mind.&ldquo;<label for=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-0 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

revolved around the Aristotelian notion that Earth was stationary and at
the center of the universe, and that the surrounding heavens were
perfection.<label for=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-1 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class=sidenote>This is of course only a subset of Aristotelian philosophy, but it suffices for current purposes.</span>
These conceptions were to be shattered by Copernicus'
insight that the earth moves and orbits the sun&mdash; a claim verified
through Galileo&rsquo;s observations of planetary motion and the mathematics
of elliptical orbits developed by Johannes Kepler. The heliocentric
system ripped Earth (and therefore humankind)<label for=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-2 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

continue to this day (see Tarnas&rsquo;s <em>Cosmos and Psyche</em> for a

place that at least in principle can be fully described by the laws of
physics.<label for=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-4 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class=sidenote>The laws of physics as described by Aristotle were modified or replaced by Newton, et.al.</span>
In this view, now referred to as &ldquo;classical physics&rdquo;&mdash; and
apparently believed by most contemporary scientists and philosophers&mdash;
the universe is a vast system of objects, fields and forces that affect
them, all interacting predictably by a set of laws that can be
completely described through mathematics. This view was born by Francis
Bacon, Galileo and Descartes in the 17th century. It coalesced around
the the physical laws first described by Isaac Newton in the late 18th
century (amended by James Maxwell in the 19th century and Albert
Einstein in the early 20th), and became dogma in the 20th century with
the Modern Synthesis of Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution by natural
selection and the genetic observations of Mendel. Classical physics
holds that the condition or configuration of any object in the universe
is fully determined by its preceding conditions. Everything&mdash; galaxy
formation, what we perceive as conscious thoughts, and everything in
between&mdash; is, at least in principle, fully predictable with sufficient
knowledge of preceding conditions. We are simply observers of a reality
that we cannot affect.</p><p>Henry Stapp summarized the view:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The ideas of Galileo Galilei, Rene&rsquo; Descartes, and Isaac Newton
created a magnificent edifice known as classical physical theory,
which was completed by the work of James Clerk Maxwell and Albert
Einstein. The central idea is that the physical universe is composed
of"material&rdquo; parts that are localizable in tiny regions, and that all
motion of matter is completely determined by matter alone, via local
universal laws. This local character of the laws is crucial. It means
that each tiny localized part responds only to the states of its
immediate neighbors: each local part &ldquo;feels&rdquo; or &ldquo;knows about&rdquo; nothing
outside its immediate microscopic neighborhood. Thus the evolution of
the physical universe, and of every system within the physical
universe, is governed by a vast collection of local processes, each of
which is &lsquo;myopic&rsquo; in the sense that it &lsquo;sees&rsquo; only its immediate
neighbors.<label for=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-5 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

"</p></blockquote><p>This set of ideas is the foundation of the scientific worldview that
through the end of the 19th century was almost universally accepted as
being true, or, as academic philosophers sometimes say, as having
ontological primacy.<label for=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-6 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type=checkbox id=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-6 class=margin-toggle>
<span class=sidenote>&ldquo;Ontological primacy&rdquo; is used here in the general sense of a fundamental truth about the nature of the world, a conclusion that
physics was widely thought to be solely responsible for (and for
some contemporary scientists and philosophers, still is).</span>
Newton connected us to the cosmos by showing
that the same principles or laws applied to both planets and everyday
objects. Maxwell unified magnetism, electricity, and light in a set of
common field equations. Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution extended the
conception of a lawful universe into the domain of biology. But none of
those expansions changed the underlying presumption of an objectively
real, purely physical, external world with definite properties that are
independent of any observer. Hillary Putnam sums it up this way:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mldr;the world consists of some fixed totality of mind-independent
objects. There is exactly one true and complete description of &rsquo;the
way the world is&rsquo;. Truth involves some sort of correspondence relation
between words or thought-signs and external things and sets of
things.&ldquo;<label for=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-7 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

The nature of claims about &ldquo;truth&rdquo; are discussed briefly below and
in XXX</span></p></blockquote><p>As Jerry Coyne says in The Atheist&rsquo;s Guide to Reality:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Physics is causally closed and causally complete. The only causes in
the universe are physical, and everything in the universe that has a
cause has a physical cause. In fact, we can go further and confidently
assert that the physical facts fix all the facts.<label for=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-8 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>In this view, there is no room for free will or any non-physical force
or influence. The emergence of life is a random and, most likely, an
extremely rare occurrence&mdash; and when life does emerge it evolves in a
completely blind manner. Concepts such as mind and consciousness are
human constructs and purely derivative from physical conditions,
different in degree and outcome but not in type from any other physical
interactions. Everything that we know about the world, anything that we
can possibly know, will necessarily come through science.</p><p>It is a fundamental dogma of modern science that nothing exists that
cannot be measured, at least in principle. That includes consciousness
and all the subjective phenomena that derive from it. Spirit, meaning,
and other qualitative notions, they&rsquo;re all just electrochemical
reactions in our brain. Reality is purely physical, full stop. Feelings
of connection to something greater than ourselves such as sense of awe
or spirit are merely pre-scientific superstitions, emotional detritus
from times before we understood how the world really works.</p><p>Such is the presumption of the modern scientific program&mdash; and the idea
of reality that Wolfgang Pauli believed needed to be replaced.<label for=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-9 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type=checkbox id=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-9 class=margin-toggle>
<span class=sidenote>This, of course, is my opinion, although it appears to be consistent with the basic theme of a psychophysical model such as
outlined through Pauli&rsquo;s collaboration with Jung.</span></p><p>But some of us who are very much engaged with science&mdash; with its
consistency of evidence, its predictability and precise descriptions&mdash;
do not accept the dogma that reality is exclusively physical (in the
sense that all things that are real can be measured). Even if we cannot
articulate or conceive of what it might be, we believe there is
something else, a fundamental, qualitative and very real aspect of the
world that we have yet to more than glimpses. We believe that we are
part of something far greater than ourselves<label for=sidenote-4b50b1227c7fcf0f7c59fbc2a8a12404-10 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class=sidenote>This assumes a reasonably well-educated reader and a conventional western worldview (either secular or thoughtful theism).</span>
, something that cannot
be explained through scientific methods. This would be something like
the &ldquo;tertium quid&rdquo; that Thomas Nigel refers to in his critique of
reductive materialism (and theism) in Mind and Cosmos.</p><p>.</p></section><section><footer class=page-footer><div class=previous-post style=display:inline-block><a class=link-reverse href="https://rs1myers.github.io/hugoTufte/articles/full_humanness/?ref=footer">Â« full humanness</a></div><div class=next-post , style=display:inline-block;float:right><a class=link-reverse href="https://rs1myers.github.io/hugoTufte/articles/spiritual_frameworks/?ref=footer">spiritual frameworks Â»</a></div><ul class=page-footer-menu></ul><div class=copyright><p>&copy; 2025
